**Lore**  
Vearis, God of the Skies, reigns over the boundless heavens where wind and light entwine. Married to [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Amros\|Amros]], Goddess of the Seas, he is honored by mortals as one half of the divine union that birthed the balance between air and water, storm and calm. Together, they brought forth [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Velo\|Velo]], God of the Sun—a child born not of magic, but through divine birth, a rarity among the pantheon.

Vearis is revered as both steadfast and contemplative, a god whose domain stretches across all horizons yet whose heart remains tethered to the sea below. His love for Amros is a tale sung by sailors and sky-priests alike, symbolizing the eternal dance between cloud and wave. Though neither he nor his wife governs love, mortals pray to them in its name, believing their union proof that even gods of storm and tide can find serenity together.

Among scholars of the divine, whispers persist that Vearis may share blood with [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Calous\|Calous]], God of Death, and [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Kemara\|Kemara]], Goddess of Sleep. Though unproven, these rumors stem from the stillness that sometimes overtakes his storms—the quiet between gusts where sky and death seem to touch. Vearis himself neither confirms nor denies such lineage, preferring silence to speculation.

His symbols, clouds and sunrays, represent renewal and revelation: the promise that no storm, however fierce, endures forever. His presence is felt in the clearing of thunderheads, in the first breath of wind before dawn, and in the soaring freedom of flight.

**Worship & Teachings**  
Vearis’s faithful are sky farers, monks, and wanderers who seek clarity of purpose and strength through discipline. His teachings speak of balance in motion—how even the fiercest winds can bear grace when guided by intent. His clergy often serve as mediators, believing that tempers, like tempests, are best met with patience rather than defiance.

Temples to Vearis are built upon mountain peaks or open cliffs, designed to let the wind flow freely through their halls. Bells and chimes hang from their ceilings, singing with the breeze as acts of praise. Worshippers offer feathers, polished stones, or sky-colored fabrics during prayer, asking the god to clear their path or grant them freedom from burden.

When storms break and sunlight pierces the clouds, the faithful say it is Vearis looking down upon the world with a smile—his way of reminding mortals that calm follows even the fiercest squall.
