The Nightvale Council is made up of multiple layers of members which make up the floors of the Council's Grand Tower. The tower itself is located on the edge of the campus of Nightvale Academy and its floor levels depict the power levels and importance of the members located on each floor, the tower holds a total of 200 floors, however the top 12 (188-199) are dedicated to the head's of the council as well as the top floor being the Council's hall of Inquisition located on the 200th floor. The Nightvale Council operates 24/7 everyday of the year, with the Head Council always being on call and more than enough subordinates to account for mild flexibility. The main purpose of the Council is to intend the laws regarding summoning and the Academy are upheld and followed as intended, secondary to that would be in regards to magic items and materials.

The Council is also responsible for the formatting of challenges dedicated to the Vega level Summoning students of Nightvale Academy. While the main ideas for these challenges takes place on the lower floors of the tower, the final decision on which challenges to set comes down to the Head Council. While often times they would rather just send the challenges on their way, occasionally a challenge set forth for a specific student might peak the interest of the Head Council members; in which case a vote is to be called. The vote would decide a number of  things, if the challenge should go through as is or if it needs changing, if the students challenge should be moved off campus grounds, or even if the student is capable of such a challenge. 

The Council is comprised of twelve sectors, each sector is lead by a member of the Head Council, from there the order of operations for each sector falls in a pyramid format. A sector's leader is at the top and from there it falls to their 2nds in command, two individuals hand picked by the sector leader as possible successors. The Nightvale Council Hierarchy falls as follows:

1. Grand Councilors
