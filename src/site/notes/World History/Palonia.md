Palonia is a world full of diverse and intense magic. Magic that wasn’t always there.

The event is celebrated every year during the Summer Solstice, it’s said that [[World History/The Night of Tau\|The Night of Tau]] was the birth of the gods.

[[World History/Palonia/Countries/The Dry Basin\|The Dry Basin]]: a dry island to the western most part of Palonia.
