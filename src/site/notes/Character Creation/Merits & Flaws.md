Players will be given a number of points to distribute amongst their merits and flaws. An equal number of points must be slotted across both merits and flaws. (ex: 5 points to merits + 5 points to flaws = 10 points)

Merits will act as "buffs" to the PC depending on the description of the merit. Flaws in turn will act as "de-buffs" to the PC depending on the description of the flaw. At different points throughout the campaign players will be asked to select from a new Merit and Flaw board which will be added below.
