## The Legend of The Curse of Perception
(A children's fable)

---
Long ago, in an age when gods still walked the mortal plane, there was a goddess named **REDACTED**, revered as the divine patron of beauty and ambition. She was known for her celestial elegance and cunning wit, accustomed to commanding the adoration of mortals and inspiring reverence among her divine peers.

Her gaze fell upon a mortal prince named Kaelith, whose deeds in battle were forging a path to the throne. Kaelith was a striking figure, his broad shoulders and battle-worn armor a testament to his trials on the field of war. His golden hair, often unkempt from days in the saddle, seemed to catch the light of every sunrise, and his piercing blue eyes held the fire of determination and a touch of sorrow. He wielded his blade with the precision of a master, but it was his charisma that truly set him apart. His speeches rallied armies, inspiring loyalty even among the weary and downtrodden.

**REDACTED** watched as Kaelith led his forces from one victory to the next, her admiration growing with each triumph. Here was a mortal worthy of her attention, she thought, one whose ambition and strength rivaled the gods themselves. In time, admiration blossomed into love—a divine affection that **REDACTED**  believed could not be denied.

Yet Kaelith’s heart already belonged to another. In a quiet village at the edge of his kingdom, a young woman named Seris awaited his return. Seris was as unassuming as the wildflowers she gathered in the meadows, her beauty radiant but unadorned. Her hair, the color of rich chestnut, fell in loose waves that framed a face warmed by a perpetual soft smile. Her hazel eyes seemed to catch every detail, reflecting both kindness and wisdom beyond her years. She was loved by her community for her healing hands and her unwavering compassion, traits that had captivated Kaelith during a chance meeting years prior.

Unlike **REDACTED**, who offered celestial riches, Seris gave Kaelith something far more profound—peace. In her presence, the burdens of war and the weight of his ambition faded, leaving behind only the simplicity of shared moments and whispered promises beneath the stars.

When **REDACTED** descended to the mortal plane, disguised as a noblewoman, she sought to win Kaelith’s heart with gifts that would rival any mortal offering. She presented him with a flawless diamond that shone like a captured star and a cloak woven from starlight itself. Yet Kaelith, while courteous, accepted these gifts with the air of a man already fulfilled. “Your generosity humbles me,” he said, his tone polite but distant. “But my heart is pledged to another.”

**REDACTED'S** pride turned to rage. How could this mortal, so small in the grand scheme of existence, reject her? Worse, how could he choose a mere peasant girl over a goddess?

Her jealousy festered, and as Kaelith led his armies to another campaign, **REDACTED** lingered in the village. Disguising herself as Kaelith, she approached Seris under the cover of night, her voice an imitation of the prince’s own.

Seris descended from her modest home, her simple dress swaying in the evening breeze, her face lit by the glow of a lantern she carried. “Kaelith?” she asked, her voice filled with hope.

“Yes, my love,” **REDACTED** replied, extending a small, elegant vial. “A gift for you to remember me by until I return. It is a perfume of poppies, crafted to capture the essence of our love.”

Seris, her heart full of devotion, accepted the vial without question. As she returned to her home, **REDACTED** vanished into the night, resuming her true form under the shadow of the moon. By the time Kaelith returned from war, the curse had taken hold.

No matter how he tried, Kaelith could no longer see Seris. When he looked at her directly, she vanished from his sight, becoming nothing more than a ghost in the corner of his vision. Her voice remained, hauntingly clear and always accurate to her location, but the dissonance between what he could hear and what he could not see began to wear on him. He searched desperately for a cure, consulting healers, priests, and even wizards, but none could undo the work of a vengeful goddess.

For Seris, the curse was a torment of isolation. Though Kaelith’s love remained steadfast, the inability to truly connect began to weigh on her soul. Over time, she withdrew from the world, her once vibrant spirit fading like a dying ember. When she passed into legend, bards would sing of her as the unseen bride, the shadowed love that a mighty prince could never hold.

Kaelith, burdened by guilt and grief, turned his focus to his kingdom. But even as he built a legacy of peace and prosperity, the memory of Seris lingered, a bittersweet reminder of what he had lost.

**REDACTED'S** curse, however, did not end with Seris. Its magic endured, twisting through the ages. Those who invoked **REDACTED'S** name in desperation or rejected the affections of the powerful were said to find themselves afflicted, a reminder that the gods, for all their might, could never compel true love.
