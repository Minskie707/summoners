Fostrela is one of the countries that was once a part of the lands known as [[World History/Keatara\|Keatara]]. The country is full of miles of thick woods and mountain regions. Cities and towns dot the lands, most easily accessible by cart. Fostrela is known as the most diverse country in [[World History/Palonia\|Palonia]], mostly due to the [[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]] which sits in the North-Western part of the country's capital, Vixgate. The Academy is highly selective of its students, which it can afford to be since itâ€™s the only magic academy in the world. Though the academy is a highlight and brings the majority of residents to Fostrela, the rest of the country is full of festivals and markets throughout the year that bring many of those without children. Fostrela is ruled by [[Important People & Noble Families/The Cynan Royal Family\|The Cynan Royal Family]], who reside in Vixgate.
