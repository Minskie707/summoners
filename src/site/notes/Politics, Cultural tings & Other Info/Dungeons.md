Dungeons look like portals of differing color, however where you can see a faded image of the other side through ordinary portals, the other side to these portals appear as thick fog with nothing to be seen from the outside. Once a being steps foot on the other side the world around them may appear drastically different, many are reported to be open terrain however a few rare dungeons have been found to have enclosed interiors. Most dungeons may remain open when stepped in however in rare cases of unknown causes the portals may "lock" not allowing anyone or anything to pass in or out of the dungeon until its completion. 

The generation of dungeons is relatively unknown, the only common factor that has been found with the appearance of all the dungeons is the pooling Ether left under the portal. Whenever a dungeon gate is closed the only trace left of it is the puddle or sometimes pool of Ether from where the gate sat, often times these puddles can be collected by those who closed the dungeon to add to their profit. Dungeon entrances can seemingly generate anywhere, while commonly generating in the vast plains or forests of Palonia they sometimes end up taking out buildings to end up in the middle of a town or city, however this is rather rare and has only happened a few times of note.

Due to the dangers that come with them, Dungeons have many rules and regulations. While most countries have individual rules for dungeons there are some base regulations set forth by [[Nightvale/The Nightvale Council\|The Nightvale Council]] long ago, there was once a time where they found interest in the dungeons however they have begun to turn away focusing instead on their Academy and crystals. Dungeon regulations are rather simple:

- A party or individual looking to clear a Dungeon must be a member or an owner of a guild; the only exceptions to this are members of the Nightvale Council, members of the ruling families, and deities if they so wish.
- Students of Nightvale Academy must be accompanied by at least 1 member of staff; a teacher or a lower ranking member of the council would apply.
- Students are restricted from going into red gates, however if the color changes once inside there is an exception.
- Payments for the dungeons are given out after completion, to be split evenly among the survivors.
- Dungeons are no law zones, meaning the only rules or laws that matter once inside are the dungeon regulations themselves.
- 
- Once inside survival should be your priority (this is more of a suggestion than a regulation)

As mentioned dungeons come in different colors, the colors of the gates can often correlate to their difficulty, however there is not way to tell what lies inside without entering oneself. Dungeons are commonly scouted out before being posted for clearing, this will give a general description of the interior of the dungeon as well as potential information on what enemies one would be dealing with once inside. Below is a list of the colors.

- Gold - the most common gate, difficulty tends to be the easiest of all the gates
- Green - the second most common gate, tends to be the second easiest
- Blue - uncommon, has only generated on cliffs, medium difficulty
- Purple -  rare, hard difficulty, never scouted, most require 2 parties to enter
- Red - extremely rare, known as lock gates, never scouted, very hard difficulty, often require multiple parties
