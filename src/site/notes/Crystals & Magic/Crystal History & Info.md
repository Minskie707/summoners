Crystals are the most finicky of materials, also one of the most dangerous. Made of pure condensed magic, crystals (magic crystals to be specific, not gem crystals) have an unknown number of types. The most used would be Spirit crystals for communication and Memory crystals (see [[Crystals & Magic/Crystal Types\|Crystal Types]]).

  

The magic of crystals was given to the world of [[World History/Palonia\|Palonia]] by the goddess of Magic and Memory, Uril. Her meteor, though catastrophic in size, was full of different kinds of crystals. The meteorite itself has shown to grow crystals when in the correct environment for them. Uril had the special ability to make different kinds of crystals, new magic. For a time she would make the crystals mortals needed most, crystals of light, spirit crystals, memory crystals, and many more. Her original temple in the Shattered Isles is said to have been spectacular, however time has not been kind. The art on the walls of the temple seem to tell stories of a cave full of magic crystals, a cave Uril had seemed to call home once. No one has ever found this cave, its entrance seems to have been lost to history.

  

“Crystals? Beautiful aren’t they? Many say… fragile, but only the container is. The energy, is deadly. The pure strands of magic, can you feel them? — Careful now, I’d hate for this whole place to detonate. The exterior of the crystal might seem fragile, however the energy is explosive… so do be careful.” — The goddess of Magic and Memory, [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Uril\|Uril]], Year of Arcturus 217 ATNOT

For unknown reasons, Uril has left the mortals of Palonia. Seemingly taking her cave of crystals and magic with her. Though her main temple seems to be in disrepair, small shrines stand in every magic shop to commemorate the goddess. The crystals that were left when she vanished have recently begun to dwindle, with less and less meteorite being retained from the original stone; as crystal extraction breaks some of the meteor with it. The crystals that once helped so many in their day to days, have stopped being available in many magic shops.
