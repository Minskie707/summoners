#  The Realms of Palonia

> _“Five lands divided by sea and circumstance, yet bound by the same sky that once burned with falling stars.”_  
> — Archivist Marellon of Nightvale Academy

[[World History/Palonia\|Palonia]] is a land shaped by its independence. Each of its five nations governs its own continent, each vast enough to sustain its people and their ambitions. Their rulers, traditions, and philosophies differ greatly—some bound by blood, others by invention, and a few by nothing at all. Though their borders are distant, their stories remain entwined through trade, conflict, and the remnants of [[World History/The Night of Tau\|The Night of Tau]].

## [[World History/Palonia/Countries/Abus (Ah-boos)\|Abus (Ah-boos)]] — The Mountain Kingdom

**Ruling Power:** [[Noble Families, Important People, & Guilds/The Silvestre Royal Family\|The Silvestre Royal Family]]  
**Form of Rule:** Monarchy (Hereditary, Eldest Heir)  
**Capital:** Stextin  
**Trade & Travel:** Restricted  
**Cultural Ideal:** _“Strength is wealth, and wealth is strength.”_

The mountain kingdom of **Abus** stands proud and fortified, its steep valleys and snow-bound passes guarded by the might of the **Silvestre line**. Rule is absolute beneath the crown, passed to the eldest of royal blood. The people of Abus measure power not in nobility or heritage, but in what one can build, claim, or conquer.

Its borders are notoriously tight, with all incoming travelers and goods strictly monitored. Yet those who are permitted entry find a realm of unshakable discipline, wealth earned through hardship, and artistry born from the mountain’s heart.

**Ruling Power:** [[Noble Families, Important People, & Guilds/The Cynan Royal Family\|The Cynan Royal Family]]  
**Form of Rule:** Monarchy (Patrilineal Succession)  
**Capital:** Vixgate

**Cultural Ideal:** _“Knowledge is dominion.”_

Where Abus prizes fortitude, **Fostrela** venerates intellect. Its monarchs, the **Cynan Family**, rule with elegance and precision—though the crown traditionally falls only to a male heir. The forests of Fostrela sprawl across its continent like veins of emerald, feeding both spirit and study.

At the nation’s heart stands **[[Nightvale/The Nightvale Council\|The Nightvale Council]]**, an assembly of mages, scholars, and political leaders whose authority extends beyond any royal bloodline. The Council’s decrees are law not only in Fostrela, but often influence policy across Palonia itself. Even the Cynans bow—at least in public—to its decisions.

**Form of Rule:** Matriarchal Monarchy  
**Capital:** Nagos

**Cultural Ideal:** _“Grace is power refined.”_

The luminous country of **Estrye** thrives under the wisdom of its **Citrela Matriarchs**, fae-blooded sovereigns whose rule predates even the foundations of other realms. In Estrye, lineage flows through the women of the family, and leadership is seen as both divine duty and art form.

Estrye’s people embrace diplomacy, ritual, and innovation, believing that beauty and progress are intertwined. Though its borders are open, visitors find their stay governed by etiquette and quiet observation. Estrye’s magic is old and deliberate, its politics layered with unspoken rules that only the keenest mind can navigate.

**Form of Rule:** Dictatorship  
**Capital:** Swiftstone  
**Trade & Travel:** Closed; Monitored Ports  
**Cultural Ideal:** _“Control is survival.”_

Beneath the sun-scorched deserts of the **Dry Basin** lies **Swiftstone**, capital of the **Alphus Family**, whose dominion rose in the wake of the _Night of Tau_. Once a refuge for the condemned, the Basin transformed into a thriving—and ruthless—nation under Alphus rule.

The Alphus Family governs with absolute authority. Negotiation and dissent are relics of the past. Trade routes are tightly managed, and all ships entering their ports face rigorous inspections and taxation. Yet for all its harshness, the Basin gleams with ingenuity. Artificers and merchants alike thrive beneath the shadow of control, carving fortune from the sands.

**Form of Rule:** Self-Governed Communities  
**Capital:** Hythe  
**Trade & Travel:** Open  
**Cultural Ideal:** _“All knowledge is freedom.”_

Fragments of land scattered like glass upon the sea, the **Shattered Isles** are home to inventors, explorers, and wanderers. No law binds them, yet few lands are as peaceful. The people live by mutual respect and personal code, fostering a culture of self-regulation and cooperation.

Where others see chaos, the Isles see opportunity. Its inhabitants pursue invention and discovery without restriction—believing every individual contributes to the betterment of the world. Ships from every nation dock at their ports, bringing trade, rumor, and the occasional troublemaker.

# Travel & Transport in Palonia

From enchanted sails to beasts of burden, Palonia’s methods of travel are as diverse as its nations. Artificers across the continents constantly push the limits of ether and crystal technology, producing wonders both practical and perilous.
([[Crystals & Magic/Crystal History & General Information\|Crystal History & General Information]])

### Common Modes of Transport

- **Ocean Ships & Boats.** The backbone of intercontinental trade.
    
- **Airships.** Massive vessels resembling their oceanic counterparts, lifted by _gravity crystals_ and steered by wind currents.
    
- **Mounts.** From horses to dragons, every region favors its own companions of travel.
    
- **Carts & Wagons.** Reliable, sturdy, and easily enchanted for light protection.

## The Aetherglide Board

_Wondrous Item, Vehicle, Very Rare_

An **Aetherglide Board** is a single-rider levitating device that harnesses gravity crystals and ether channels to propel its user mere inches above the ground—or higher, in skilled hands. Agile enough for tricks, stable enough for long journeys, these boards are beloved by artificers, couriers, and daring adventurers.

Each board is crafted for purpose, its design reflecting the temperament of its rider. Though costly to produce, they can be upgraded, enchanted, or customized for both form and function.
