The god of the Sun. The only deity within the mortal world who was born from his motherâ€™s womb. He is believed to be one of the strongest deities of the second generation due to this fact, however it is unconfirmed. He is married to [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Aella\|Aella]], and has three children; [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Adone\|Adone]], [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Iros\|Iros]] and [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Sotar\|Sotar]]. Despite his pleas with Aella to carry the children to term, he went along with her final decision of birthing them from flowers. Mortals have noticed how he has stayed around [[World History/Palonia/Countries/Estrye (Es-tray)\|Estrye (Es-tray)]], staying within his temple in Vilco; refusing to speak of his wife or missing children. His symbols are the sun and sunflowers.
