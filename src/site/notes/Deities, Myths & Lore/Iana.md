**Lore**  
Iana, Goddess of Jealousy, is a being both adored and avoided in equal measure. She embodies the quiet ache that follows beauty, success, or love—the emotion mortals fear to name but feel in every glance. Though few build temples in her honor, every heart that beats with longing gives her silent tribute.

Residing within the shadowed periphery of **[[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]]**, Iana lingers close to mortal ambition. It is said her presence can be felt in the hush between rivals, or in the moment one looks upon another’s triumph and wonders, _“Why not me?”_ Scholars claim she feeds on envy not as malice, but as sustenance—born from the belief that desire, in its purest form, is the spark that drives all creation.

Her symbols are **emeralds and serpents**, and legends tell that she can take the form of a great serpent with eyes of green fire. Some say she slithers unseen through the academy gardens at night, whispering doubts into the ears of students who gaze too long upon others’ success. Others believe she hides within mirrors, showing mortals not who they are—but who they wish to be.

Despite her fearsome reputation, Iana is not purely cruel. She teaches that jealousy, when acknowledged rather than denied, can be a mirror leading toward self-discovery. Her truest followers seek not to destroy what they envy, but to understand the yearning beneath it. Those who master such insight often find their ambitions sharpened, their will unbreakable.

Iana is the confirmed sister of **[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Valentina\|Valentina]], Goddess of Luck**, their bond complex and eternal. Where Valentina’s laughter draws light, Iana’s envy follows like a shadow. Together, they represent fortune’s dual nature—the joy of gain and the ache of absence. Though they rarely meet, it is said that when they do, chance itself bends: storms cease, dice halt midair, and hearts across Fostrela skip a beat.

Rumors persist that **[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Aster\|Aster]], God of Knowledge**, shares divine blood with them, yet this remains unproven. Iana neither confirms nor denies the claim—only smiles and says,

> “He may have read the truth, but knowledge and kinship are rarely the same.”

**Worship & Teachings**  
Iana’s following is small but deeply devoted. Her devotees, called **The Covetous**, build private altars of emerald and silver, hidden in homes or beneath beds, where they confess their jealousies in candlelight. Offerings often include mirrors, snake carvings, or objects taken from rivals—not in hatred, but as symbols of the self they wish to surpass.

She blesses those who dare to confront their own envy rather than bury it, granting them insight, ambition, and the will to change. Yet to those who let jealousy consume them, her favor becomes a curse—dreams haunted by serpents, eyes clouded with green flame, and hearts that rot from desire unfulfilled.

It is said that when two rivals stand at the brink of greatness, Iana watches closely—smiling softly, her reflection gleaming in the eyes of both.
