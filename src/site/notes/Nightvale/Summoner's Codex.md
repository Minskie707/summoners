The Summoner’s Codex is in its simplest form, a set of rules and suggestions. Rules that all students must abide by at [[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]]. The Codex shall be as important as the students' holy grounds. Breaking the Codex leaves students to [[Nightvale/The Nightvale Council\|The Nightvale Council]]’s decisions, to ignore a direct summon by the Council is punishable by execution. The Codex is as follows:

  

“Summoners are strongest alongside their party, and a party is only as strong as its weakest. Though no harm shall come from a fellow party member, other parties are of their own volition. Summoners, and students alike, are not allowed to harm another while they sleep. Matters should be settled on the mat during combat challenges. To attack another student without rightful cause is insulting to what we stand for as summoners, justice. No one, not even a legacy is exempt from punishment. All assignments given are to be completed unless exempted by the assigner. An assignment given directly from the Headmistress must be completed immediately and without delay. There is a fine line known as control with summons, lose it and you might lose more than just your mind.” — Professor of Strategy, Janik Voight, Year of Altair 242 ALTN

“Look around you, painful as it may be, you will not see many of these faces after graduation. Remember this as you look to those around you, summons are just summons, don’t lose yourself trying to save them… or worse lose those you care about. Though there is a sting, sometimes it is better to lose your summon than, to lose your person. As a final thought, reaching too far for power can and will cost you, there is always a balance.” — Professor of Creature Behavior, Odetta Voight, Year of Altair 242 ALTN

“Hard to follow that– And without losing sight of what has been said, students should hold respect for one another instead of preplaced resentment. However, that's more of a suggestion than a rule. We don’t expect you to fully change, simply to remold yourselves into the summoners you’re meant to be. Assignments are to come with instructions you should follow, however, if you do not, the consequences are yours to face. [[Nightvale/The Nightvale Council\|The Nightvale Council]] doesn’t take breaches of their rules lightly, but they aren’t without reason. One last piece of advice, sometimes there's more than one way, even if it would seem otherwise.” — Professor of Magic, Luca Kames, Year of Altair 242 ALTN

“Procyons! The eggs you’ve been given, are to be protected as if they were your life. You’ll find, once they hatch, exactly how I mean that. Although I don’t disagree with what Professor Odetta said, these are special and should be treated as such. To follow that, to harm another student’s hatchling is the same as harming them as they sleep. Inexcusable. Respect is to be earned, whether that's earning it off the bat or re-earning it. Physical matters should be handled on a mat in the pit, I won’t hear of bloodshed in the halls.” — Professor of Egg Care, Laiden Mistal, Year of Altair 242 ALTN

“Procyons! I trust you remember the rules on contact outside the academy walls. If you want to keep those precious eggs, keep contact within the walls. It’s best to learn from your classmates before venturing back out to the world. Spirit Crystals are a privilege, not a necessity. Crystals are not toys, they are dangerous materials that shouldn’t be tampered with. To tamper with a crystal is to sentence everyone to their ends.” — Administrator of Crystals, Delia Vegara, Year of Castor 836 ALTN

“As much joy as it would bring me to see all the deaths that befall you— I'd think twice before upsetting a deity. Though it's sure to be a delightful show, I'd hate for the students on cleanup duty to have to scrub you from the ceilings. Consider this your only warning, don’t cross a line you can’t come back from.” — God of Glory, [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Nythar\|Nythar]], Year of Castor 836 ALTN

“Though a student does not have expulsion to fear here, there are much scarier things, I promise you that. These walls are now your home, but I'd refrain from getting comfortable outside your dorm. Remember what this place is, what it's training you for. To some of you, that's war, to most others, glorified adventuring. Careful not to lose your heads children, there are monsters hiding in the closets here.” — Goddess of Sleep, [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Kemara\|Kemara]], Year of Castor 836 ALTN

“All of you have been issued uniforms, though these are only required for certain activities and events, such as this. You will be free to dress as you please, however, I beg you to at least let it be appropriate. Remember your schedules as you choose whatever you decide to grace us in… I'd hate to fail you on a combat assessment due to attire. Lastly, mostly for the older years, personal methods of transport are to be maintained by you. The artificers are tired of having to fix your mechanical failures, from now on fix it yourselves or lose it.” — Professor of Combat, Remo Krauze, Year of Castor 836 ALTN

“You all felt that pulse of energy as you crossed the bridges, that pull of power. Remember that pull, use it to help guide you, your power might know you more than you know yourself. You are not prisoners here, Procyons, it's to protect you more than you’d think. This academy is going to help shape you into who you are meant to be, think of that pull of power like the center. You will be shaped into your destiny, fighting that pull might unravel it.” — Professor of Magic, Raeme  Vegara, Year of Rana 903 ALTN

“Summons are both a part of you and the farthest from you, confusing I know. However, I won’t feed you the lie that it doesn’t hurt to lose them. You deserve that much of a truth, losing your summon, no matter how it happens… it scars you. Some of what you will see beyond these walls might haunt you for the rest of your lives, some of you might walk away a shell of your former self. There are many ways to lose yourself, many ways to lose your mind.” — Professor of Egg Care, Venus Voight, Year of Rana 903 ALTN

The Codex has been amended on multiple accounts as it was needed for the time. Updating the Codex is something that is not done without serious discussion within [[Nightvale/The Nightvale Council\|The Nightvale Council]]. Over time it’s turned more into a set of suggestions rather than rules. Make no mistake, the words of the Codex might as well be law within Nightvale. It would be wise to follow them.
