### **The Lost Continent of Keatara**

Among the histories taught across [[World History/Palonia\|Palonia]], one truth is seldom spoken in full: the tale of Keatara. Long before [[World History/The Night of Tau\|The Night of Tau]], Keatara was a continent of unparalleled beauty, a land where balance reigned and the gods themselves were said to walk. Even when magic waned in other realms, Keatara thrived with an almost divine radiance, its forests and rivers shimmering as though blessed by celestial hands.

Yet Keatara’s splendor was not eternal. On the fateful Night of Tau, when fire and stone rained upon the world, the continent suffered devastation beyond recovery. The meteors split its heart in twain, and the once-unbroken land was torn into two kingdoms: **[[World History/Palonia/Countries/Fostrela (Fahs-trel-uh)\|Fostrela (Fahs-trel-uh)]]** to the west and **[[World History/Palonia/Countries/Abus (Ah-boos)\|Abus (Ah-boos)]]** to the east. The wound of that night never healed. Though separated by sea and strife, both nations inherited fragments of Keatara’s legacy—and with them, an unending enmity. For centuries, Fostrela and Abus waged war against each other, their hatred so ancient it is older than written record. Only in recent generations has a fragile, unwilling truce bound them, though few trust it to last.

The history of Keatara itself is now a broken tapestry. Many of its chronicles were consumed by flame, flood, or war, leaving only scraps in dusty archives. What remains speaks of a continent teeming with untamed life: vast jungles, creatures of legend soaring freely across skies, and ancient wonders whose splendor dwarfed even the proudest castles of today.

Some ruins still linger, scattered across Fostrela and Abus, silent monuments to the age before the fall. Among them stands the shattered palace of Keatara’s rulers, once the seat of the **Aurelian dynasty**. That castle was cleaved in two by the meteors, half its bones resting in each kingdom, while the sea claimed the rest.

The Aurelians are remembered as sovereigns of uncommon strength and grace. Their reign was said to embody peace and prosperity, a rule closer to divine stewardship than mortal politics. Whispers claim the blood of gods coursed through their line. But their fate was sealed in the **[[Deities, Myths & Lore/War of Faiths\|War of Faiths]]**, when the Aurelians vanished without a trace. To most, their disappearance is dismissed as a casualty of war, their line extinguished in chaos. Yet among the rare texts that survive, there are hints that the truth of their fall remains hidden—buried beneath time, silence, and the rising seas.
