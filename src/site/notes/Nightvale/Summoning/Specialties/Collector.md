# **Collector Specialty**

_Summoning Discipline of [[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]]_

Collectors embody ambition sharpened into precision. Among Nightvale’s summoning disciplines, none inspire more whispered judgments—nor more begrudging respect—than these relentless curators of power. A Collector refuses limitation; where others hone a single archetype of summoned ally, Collectors instead command a _menagerie_ of wildly differing entities, each chosen to fulfill a unique tactical niche.

## **Ambition in Practice**

To become a Collector is to accept that power rarely comes in a single form. Students of this specialty excel academically, often topping their classes through sheer force of will and meticulous study. Their summons range from nimble scouts to hulking bruisers to esoteric arcane constructs, and mastering such a diverse roster requires exceptional planning, adaptability, and battlefield intellect.

Professors at Nightvale Academy speak of Collectors with thinly veiled exasperation—praising their results while privately condemning their attitude. Collectors are notorious for pushing boundaries, rewriting assignments to suit their goals, and refusing to accept “no” from either instructor or summon.

## **Philosophy of the Oath**

Every Collector swears the words that shape their discipline:

### **“My companion is mine.”**

This oath reflects an unyielding belief: power is not singular, and every bond forged is another facet of one’s strength. A Collector does not simply summon creatures—they claim them, study them, and weave them into their growing arsenal like trophies in a living gallery.

## **Public Perception**

To outsiders, Collectors are often viewed as _demanding_, _possessive_, and at times _insufferable_. The most common description among both peers and civilians is “needy brats”—a label Collectors wear with an odd indifference. For while their reputation may waver, their focus never does.

In truth, what others perceive as greed is simply clarity. Collectors know exactly what they want, and they will obtain it—whether through negotiation, intimidation, or brilliance. Their summons, diverse and carefully curated, reflect that indomitable will.
