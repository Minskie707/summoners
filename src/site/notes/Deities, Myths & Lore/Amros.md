**Lore**  
Amros, Goddess of the Seas, is both serene and unfathomable—her moods shifting with the tides she commands. She is the consort of [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Vearis\|Vearis]], God of the Skies, and mother to [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Velo\|Velo]], God of the Sun. From their union of air and water came the first dawn mist, and from that mist rose the life that would one day walk the shores of the world.

Among mortals, Amros is adored not only as the mistress of the oceans but as a symbol of love itself. Sailors, poets, and wanderers pray to her for safe passage and faithful hearts, believing her waves carry whispers of devotion across vast distances. Though Amros has never claimed dominion over love, she allows mortals their belief. To her, their faith is another kind of tide—gentle, persistent, and ever returning.

Unlike many of her divine kin, Amros despises conflict. She is a goddess of quiet endurance, favoring the patient pull of the current over the crash of the wave. When the gods wage war, she withdraws into her depths, letting the storm above exhaust itself before emerging to calm the aftermath. Her tridents, once forged by the legendary artisan [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Cilleth\|Cilleth]], were gifted to mortals as symbols of protection and mastery of the sea. The original divine tridents, however, have long been lost—either reclaimed by the ocean or reduced to relics adorning noble halls.

**Worship & Teachings**  
Amros’s worshippers include sailors, artisans, and those who seek harmony rather than conquest. Her temples are open to the sound of the waves, adorned with shells and coral, where hymns are sung in rhythm with the tide. Her clerics teach that strength lies in adaptability—that water wears down even the hardest stone through patience.

Prayers to Amros are carried upon saltwater winds, offered with pearls, driftwood, or lotus oil cast upon the sea. Her faithful believe that when the waves lap gently against the shore after a storm, it is Amros herself soothing the wounds of the world.

Though she claims no power over love, many say that to love deeply and without demand is to honor the sea—and through it, the goddess who listens in silence from beneath the waves.
