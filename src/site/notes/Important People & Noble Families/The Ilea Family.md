They own and run the [[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]], with the matriarch of their family being the Headmistress.

The matriarch, and only living parent of the Ilea Family. Her face is unknown, for she always wears a mask or headdress. Her hair is a gradient of greys. Always wearing a glove on her right hand. She is known to speak outwardly only among her council. A while back, before any of her children were born. She had a meeting with King Balor Cynan, a meeting to discuss a deal of sorts.

### Dras Ilea:

The oldest son, and the oldest child to the Ilea Family. A man in love with his own looks. His arrogance is almost as dense as the air of Edosa. He's the top of his level, Sirius, and the head of his specialty, [[Nightvale/Summoning/Specialties/Hunter\|Hunter]]. The golden boy of Nightvale. On top of his studies at the Academy he’s to be a member of the Vixgate kings guard upon graduation, making his “free time” training time.

### Zean Ilea:

The youngest son, and middle child to the Ilea Family. Unlike his brother, Zean is a much less outspoken individual. Where his brother is known to be a very loud personality, Zean sticks to the edges of conversations more. After choosing his specialty of [[Nightvale/Summoning/Specialties/Warg\|Warg]], he fell below the social ranks of his siblings. Although he is the head of his specialty, same as his brother. He is currently a Vega.

### Kwyn Ilea:

The only daughter, and the youngest child to the Ilea Family. Known as the beauty of [[World History/Palonia/Countries/Fostrela (Fahs-trel-uh)\|Fostrela (Fahs-trel-uh)]], its said that her skin glistens like the stars. Most regard her as an expressionless princess, holding a timid demeanor even for a young women of her stature. It was very rare to spot her outside the walls of the Academy, however she was always accompanied on outings. She's known to be followed closely by her brother Zean. He acts almost like a guard dog for her, and when he's no where to be found she's commonly found at the side of Alden Cynan.
