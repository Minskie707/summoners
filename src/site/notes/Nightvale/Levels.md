The school’s ([[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]]) levels also known as the schools year rankings (ex: freshmen, sophomore, etc.) show a summoner’s personal progression. Failure is not an option, never has a student left the school due to them failing a level. The Academy holds a very tight line when it comes to progression, if you cannot live up to your potential, well no one knows what happens to those who don't live up to expectations. Summoners have reported students leaving when they cant meet the expectation of the headmistress, but no one has ever reported dropping out of the school. Graduation is when students are finally gifted the official title of Summoner, but until then they are referred to as their levels followed by their specialties. (ex: Procyon Hunter, Mizar Warg, etc. after graduating you’re simply a Summoner)

Once a student accepts the letter of invitation from Nightvale Academy, they accept that there is no failing out of the academy. You either die on the pursuit of becoming a Summoner or graduate to become a Summoner.

## Procyon:

Lowest on the food chain, Procyon's are first years. Commonly just trying to learn how to handle their newfound power. Their classes might seem the easiest and most redundant in comparison to the course load of the other levels. While in some cases that's true, most believe it to be the opposite. Considering the first years have no real idea on how to handle their new abilities, or how to use their summons effectively some say its the most difficult year. With some years, Procyons have been left to care for an egg when entering the school, it is in their best interest to protect that egg with all it might cost. Because of the eggs along with some other reasons, Procyons are not allowed to leave academy grounds or contact outside the walls of the school for the first year. There are of course exceptions for certain events which allow for the first years to experience holidays and festivals alongside their peers.

The upcoming school year has added a new event for Procyon's specifically, working in part with Count Karken Spiros. The Procyon Showcase is a specialty showcase of the Academy's most promising first year students, the students will be expected to showcase their abilities to an audience of nobility and status. As first years know minimal of the art in summoning and most wouldn't even have a summon by time of this event the students will need to get creative in how they wish to showcase their power. While this event might seem frivolous, it opens many doors for the students later on as many of the guests in attendance this night hold power and favor throughout all of Palonia; and many of them are on the look out for future members of staff.

## Mizar:

Second years, not much different from first years in their coursework. Although most think first year is the easiest, second tends to be the easiest year. Gaining only one class they certainly have a better chance of doing well in their coursework. Despite being allowed off campus, Mizars are not allowed to take job postings from the public. For any sort of job you might feel the urge for, speak to the work administrator or see the board in the Mizar commons.

While some Mizars tend to get cocky with their slight status elevation, most stick to themselves or their parties, some opting to be around friends rather than party members. With minimal coursework in comparison to the upperclassmen the main goal for Mizars tends to be bonding with their first summon, weather or not they have found one by the start of the school year or not, a Mizar must break through the first bond in this year.

## Polaris:

Polaris tends to be where the majority start getting cocky with their abilities. Growing arrogant and egotistical as most summoners do as they progress. This year gains an exceptionally difficult class, one of magic. Though some might already be magic users, this class will not teach you anything of the ordinary population’s abilities. Polaris also comes with the privilege of taking jobs outside of the academy walls. However it is a privilege, meaning if you don't make it back before your allotted job leave is up you will lose this privilege for a time. The jobs a Polaris wishes to take must also be approved by both a member of staff (professor, deity, etc.), and The Nightvale Council before the student leaves.

This is also the first year that allows students to join or form guilds; granted the student has the funds to pay for what is required in the city they wish to form a guild in. When a student shows interest in a guild they are not allowed to sign contracts with any guildhall until their education at Nightvale Academy is completed, however this does not apply to students forming their own guilds so long as the students priority remains with the Academy. For a student to join a guild there is a special process, since students aren't allowed to sign contracts with guilds so long as their a student at the Academy, they may join guilds as honorary members; this basically means they have decided that no matter what they *will* sign a contract with that guild once eligible. Students may elect not to join a guild however parties without fully documented members will not be allowed to run dungeons, which would lock the party out of some of the higher paying jobs.

## Vega:

Vega is where most gain valuable experience in combat, as this is the year when [[Nightvale/Challenges\|Challenges]] start. Challenges make being a Vega exceptionally difficult and deadly, about half the level makes it to the next year. Though not all challenges are deadly, all are painful.

While students are allowed to join guilds in their Polaris year, its more common to see them allying themselves with guilds during their Vega year. Unfortunately due to the challenges most students close themselves off within their Vega year, this seems to be when many start to align themselves with their party in social standings. 

## Regulus:

Regulus is the fifth year, still having challenges. However this year comes with, arguably, the most exciting class. One that means to prepare you for the events that Regulus students are to participate in at the end of the year; [[Events & Festivals/The Summoners Gauntlet\|The Summoners Gauntlet]] and [[Events & Festivals/The Summoning Games\|The Summoning Games]]. These events will serve as a test of not only the students abilities as a summoner but the summons abilities and development as well.

For many Regulus students, the focus on their summon turns some of them to a more guarded stance. By this year most students have a mount or an Aetherglide board of their own for ease of transport during jobs. While some students might be lucky enough to not experience this, many tend to change by their Regulus year, turning into someone that their family might not even recognize. 

## Sirius:

Sirius is the final year. This year is also when the challenges kick up a notch. Due to challenges the graduating class tends to dwindle, becoming much smaller than the first years. Making it to Sirius means you have almost mastered your abilities, some who make it to this level gain some special abilities.

Sirius is a year of pride but also hope for many students, the light at the end of the tunnel you could say. Many graduate to join the Nightvale Council or they turn back to their homes to continue their lives as best they can, a rare few turn to adventuring. As Summoners many graduate students have the pick of whatever profession they may want. The finale year of the Academy is when many shift their focus to better prepare for their chosen professions, in some cases students prepare to rule their home countries.
