The Shattered Isles stands where a once beautiful and deep island forest used to stand. Much like [[World History/Keatara\|Keatara]], it was subject to destruction on [[World History/The Night of Tau\|The Night of Tau]]. As the name suggests, the Island shattered into smaller islands. The Island was believed to be uninhabited before Tau, Archmages and scientists set out to research the lands after The Night of Tau. Whatever or whoever had been stopping them before wasn’t around any longer. They set up what began as two outposts, but quickly turned into two small cities. Hythe, and Valross. However, in their exploration, they came across something unplanned for, the inhabitants of the so-called *uninhabitable* islands. Groups of savage tribes lined the eastern coasts near [[World History/Palonia/Countries/Estrye (Es-tray)\|Estrye (Es-tray)]], they labeled the camps as Edosa. A larger island to the south of the main island houses the remnants of [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Uril\|Uril]]'s temple.

  

## Hythe:

The “capital” of The Shattered Isles. Built in the center of a natural stone wall, the city is half built, half carved out of stone. The climate is hot and humid, thick jungles surround the city. Known as a land of innovation, it's full of science and research. Scientists and mages alike find themselves with new inventions almost every day.

  

## Valross:

The smaller city of the two, its climate is a moderate temperature but very humid due to the dense jungle. 

  

## Edosa:

The tribal camps of The Shattered Isles. Having been pushed back by the newer inhabitants of their lands they resort to living on the outer “islands” of the eastern coasts. The climate is warm with high humidity.
