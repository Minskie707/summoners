## **The Laws of the Tribal Peoples of Palonia**

Though few tribes remain across the fractured lands of [[World History/Palonia\|Palonia]], those that do still honor the same ancient codes of conduct — laws born long before the founding of any kingdom or council. These laws are upheld not by parchment and seal, but by memory, blood, and oath.

While every tribe maintains its own customs, the principles below are considered **the Shared Laws of the Tribes**, a sacred framework recognized by nearly every chieftain, elder, and spirit-keeper who yet walks the land. These laws exist alongside those of Palonia’s nations, though they are enforced by the tribes themselves.

### **The Shared Laws of the Tribes**

**1. Sovereignty of the People**  
Each tribe is recognized as its own sovereign people, beholden to none but their chosen leaders and ancestral traditions. They may create and enforce their own laws, and no outside ruler holds dominion over their governance.

**2. Judgment of Kin**  
A tribesperson accused of any crime — whether upon tribal ground or in foreign lands — shall be judged by their own tribe. This judgment must follow due process according to the tribe’s customs. Only in cases where no tribe remains to claim the accused may a foreign court intervene.

**3. Claim of the Land**  
Tribes may settle upon unoccupied lands, claiming them in the tribe’s name so long as the land is not under rightful stewardship. Host nations may request a tax or offering for continued residence, but such a term, once agreed upon, **cannot be altered or increased** without mutual consent.

**4. Freedom from Council Oversight**  
No tribe within Palonia has ever signed the Treaty of Nightvale, and thus no tribal law falls under the jurisdiction of **[[Nightvale/The Nightvale Council\|The Nightvale Council]]**. Tribes retain the right to refuse decrees, summons, or regulations issued by the Council or its affiliates.

**5. The Rite of Joining**  
Outsiders seeking to join a tribe must complete the sacred rites prescribed by that tribe — rites that vary from simple acts of devotion to grueling trials of endurance and spirit. Upon completion, the initiate relinquishes all former titles and family names, reborn as one of the tribe.

**6. The Right to Secrecy**  
The tribes are under no obligation to reveal their internal laws, traditions, or sacred knowledge to outsiders. What is spoken within the fires of the tribe belongs to the tribe alone. Secrecy is not considered deceit, but survival.

### **The State of the Tribes Today**

Though once widespread across Palonia, the number of tribes dwindles with each passing generation. Many have chosen to wander — nomadic, unseen, and self-reliant — while others have withdrawn deep into the forests, deserts, and mountains to guard their last sanctuaries.

Yet, in recent years, ominous patterns have emerged. Entire tribal villages have been discovered **reduced to blackened ash**, their people vanished without struggle or trace. Adventurers and scholars alike tell of villages that seemed alive only days before — fires still warm, tools untouched — but utterly empty.

Some blame the resurgence of [[Politics, Cultural tings & Other Info/Ether\|Ether]] corruption from the west; others whisper that the gods themselves reclaim their forgotten children. Whatever the truth, the silence left behind feels heavier than any grave.

To those who still follow the old ways, the tribes are not gone — merely hidden, watching from the mists of the world, waiting for the time when Palonia remembers its roots.
