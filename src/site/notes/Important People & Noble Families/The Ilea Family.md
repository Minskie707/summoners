### ✦ The Ilea Family ✦

_Of veils, power, and silent roots_

The **Ilea family** appeared as mysteriously as the Academy itself—emerging on the **[[World History/The Night of Tau\|The Night of Tau]]** with their ancestral estate in tow. No records speak of their lineage, and no scholar claims knowledge of their homeland. They govern [[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]] as its rulers, protectors, and architects. The matriarch, **Headmistress Caipra Ilea**, arrived alone, but her children—Dras, Zean, and Kwyn—have since walked the academy halls, seemingly born of the academy’s very breath.

#### Caipra Ilea — _The Headmistress_

Rare is the soul who hears her voice. Rarer still is the one who sees her face.

**Caipra Ilea**, the veiled sovereign of Nightvale Academy, is both matriarch and mystery. Her visage is ever-concealed by silvered masks or grand headdresses, her hair falling like mist—grey fading into dusk. None can say what lies beneath the glove that binds her right hand, nor the truth of the pact once whispered between her and **King Balor Cynan**, before her heirs drew breath.

She speaks only in council, and even then, her words are weighed like spell components—intentional, precise, dangerous. Some say she is centuries old. Others say she is older still, a relic of the age before kings.

To defy her is to tempt fate. To serve her is to study power incarnate.

#### Dras Ilea — _The Golden Fang_

Eldest of the Ilea heirs, **Dras** is as infamous for his vanity as he is revered for his prowess. Handsome, arrogant, and undeniably gifted, he sits at the summit of **Sirius**, the highest level of Nightvale’s education, and leads the prestigious **Hunter** specialty. Known as the "Golden Boy" of the Academy, Dras does not merely study—he dominates.

In addition to his duties at Nightvale, he is slated to join the **Vixgate King’s Guard** upon graduation, further solidifying the family's entwinement with royal affairs. Despite his self-importance, few question his skill. His blades are as sharp as his tongue, and both have drawn blood.

#### Zean Ilea — _The Silent Howl_

Middle child and second son, **Zean** walks in his elder brother’s shadow—but not with resentment. Quiet, reserved, and deeply observant, Zean speaks little, yet sees much. Unlike Dras, he does not crave the spotlight. His choice of the **Warg** specialty—wild, instinctual, untamed—pushed him lower in the academy’s social ladder. Still, he leads his discipline as Head, currently standing at the **Vega** level.

He is known to linger on the periphery of gatherings, rarely alone, often watching. Some say he listens more to the bones of the world than to its people.

#### Kwyn Ilea — _The Moonlit Heiress_

Youngest of the Ilea children, **Kwyn** is the Academy’s enigma wrapped in beauty. Her presence is rare, her expressions rarer still. Her skin is said to shimmer like starlight beneath moon-kissed skies, earning her the title “Beauty of [[World History/Palonia/Countries/Fostrela (Fahs-trel-uh)\|Fostrela (Fahs-trel-uh)]].” Timid in speech and movement, she carries the weight of quiet nobility, always observed but seldom known.

Though rarely seen beyond Nightvale’s walls, when she does venture into the city, it is never alone. Zean, ever the sentinel, trails her like a silent guardian. On the rare occasions he is absent, she is found beside **Alden Cynan**, the Crown Prince of Vixgate—fueling whispers of betrothal, diplomacy, or something darker still.
