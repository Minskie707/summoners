## 🜂 **The Silvestre Royal Family of Abus** 🜂  
_High Lords of the North, Bearers of the Emerald Flame_

In the frost-bitten reaches of northern Palonia lies the mountain realm of **Abus**, a kingdom carved from stone and pride, ruled by the ancient and revered **House Silvestre**. Though they hail from a branch of a long-forgotten royal line, the Silvestres have more than proven their claim through strength, wisdom, and a bond with their people as enduring as the peaks that surround them.

Their dominion flows from the capital city of **Stextin**, a jewel nestled in the icy heights. Their name—**Silvestre**—is taken from the _silvanite emerald_, a rare and radiant gemstone found only within the caverns of Abus, prized for its shifting green hues and said to pulse with latent magic.

Unlike many royal houses, the Silvestre ascension came not by conquest nor bloodright, but through a storied election in ages past. The people of Abus—pragmatic and proud—chose them as sovereigns, a tradition long abandoned in most other lands. And while foreign rumors often paint the Silvestres in tones of secrecy or scandal, within their own borders they are regarded with loyalty and love.

Yet even the highest peaks cast long shadows. Among the nobility of Palonia, whispers abound—most notably regarding **Princess Sira**, the family’s eldest by age, yet not by blood. Tales spread beyond Abus claim she is the product of King Breixo’s dalliance with another, a scandalous tale untrue. In truth, Sira is adopted, brought into the royal fold as a child. While she bears no claim to the throne, she bears the name Silvestre with honor and pride.

The true heir, by right of blood, is **Princess Calisto**, daughter of Breixo and Onda—an icy flame forged in ambition, already set upon a path that may change the course of history.

Though not the most widespread in influence, the Silvestres remain a force unto themselves: **a family of frost and fire, heart and steel**, standing resolute beneath the snowcapped heavens of their beloved homeland.

### 🜁 **King Breixo Silvestre, the Ice King**

**High Sovereign of Abus, Warden of the Mountain Realms**

A towering figure both in presence and legacy, **King Breixo Silvestre** is a Frostborn Goliath whose bloodline is whispered to predate even the first kings of Palonia. Beneath his formidable stature and glacier-carved features lies a heart of tempered iron—unyielding, yet just. Known among his kin as the “Gentle Giant,” Breixo wields his voice like a warhorn and his judgment like a smith’s hammer: heavy, deliberate, and final.

Though beloved by his people for his wisdom and strength, he is not one to suffer insult lightly—**those who speak ill of his family often find the mountains less merciful than their king**. A sovereign of few words and deep thoughts, Breixo walks the line between mercy and might with masterful grace.

### 🜄 **Queen Onda Silvestre, the Silver Dragon**

**Architect of the Arcane, Ice-Wrought Mind of Abus**

If Breixo is the mountain, **Queen Onda** is its shadow—silent, sharp, and ever-watching. Cold of gaze and calm of breath, Onda is a tactician without peer and a mistress of the arcane arts. Her stare can quiet a room, and her words—few as they are—carry the weight of stone. While foreign dignitaries may mistake her silence for distance, her people know her true warmth lies in action, not display.

It was Onda who designed the **Celestial Forges of Abus**, revolutionizing the kingdom’s smithing with safer, stronger constructions. Rarely seen without her retinue of handmaidens or her daughters, her rare public appearances alongside the king inspire hushed awe—and wild rumor.

### 🜃 **Princess Sira Silvestre**

**The Adopted Star, Heart of Stextin**

Though not born of royal blood, **Princess Sira Silvestre** has captured the hearts of Abus like few ever could. Discovered in the orphanage of Stextin and adopted on her sixth name day, she was brought into the fold of the Silvestres not as a symbol, but as a daughter—beloved, chosen, and cherished.

Now seventeen and enrolled at **Nightvale Academy** as a Mizar, Sira is known for her brilliance, warmth, and grace. Her green eyes and sun-kissed skin mark her as a child of distant origins, but her poise and presence declare her nobility unmistakably. Though she holds no claim to the throne, she holds something far rarer: **the love of the people, unearned but never questioned**.

### 🜂 **Princess Calisto Silvestre**

**The Winter Heir, Daughter of Stone and Flame**

**Calisto Silvestre**, daughter of Breixo and Onda, is a study in stillness and storm. At sixteen, she already commands a room with her presence—eyes like frozen seas, hair the color of fallen snow, and horns curling like obsidian crowns from her brow. Where others see beauty, she sees burden; where others praise her lineage, she forges her own purpose.

Set to attend Nightvale in the coming year, Calisto's aspirations are whispered from the taverns to the temples: **she seeks to become the youngest Dragon Summoner in living memory**. Dragons are fierce, proud creatures—just like her—and it seems only fitting that one day, she may stand beside one as its equal.

### 🜄 **Prince Leon Silvestre**

**The Shrouded Flame, Son of Frost and Fury**

The youngest of the Silvestre line, **Prince Leon** is a contradiction in flesh: the pale blue skin of his Goliath heritage paired with the frame of one yet to grow into it. Fourteen years old and often found in quiet corners with ink-stained fingers and a furrowed brow, Leon is thoughtful, tempestuous, and endlessly observant.

While he bears his father's features—the pale skin, the shaggy white hair—he also carries the weight of his insecurities. Smaller than his peers and quick to anger, Leon shuns the spotlight, his passions simmering beneath the surface like magma under ice. But make no mistake: **the boy who hides in shadows may one day blaze brighter than them all**.
