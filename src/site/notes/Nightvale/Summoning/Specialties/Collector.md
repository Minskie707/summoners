Collectors are demanding and intelligent. Determined to get what they want when they want it, Collectors aren't known to take no for an answer. Though they tend to have the highest scores in classes, the disdain from the teachers towards them is obvious. Where some specialties prefer having summons of mostly one strength. Collectors, well collect different summons of different strengths. Having a mix of drastically different summons calls for strategy and intelligence in how to use each summon to the best of their ability.

  

The Collector’s words are “My companion is mine”, their oath refers to their need for different forms of power. Collectors are seen as “needy brats” by a majority of the population, though most don’t care what the population thinks of them.
