The boards listed below will give the player character possible benefits within the campaign, however these benefits come with a cost in added flaw. This is to (try to) help force there to be at least a semblance of balance from the Merits and Flaws. At the start of the campaign players will be given 25 points to slot into the Merit and Flaw boards below, at every level up PCs will be given 10 points to slot where they wish. Over the course of the campaign players will be given the chance to earn more points outside of leveling, at the DM's discretion.

Players will be given a number of points to distribute amongst their merits and flaws. An equal number of points must be slotted across both merits and flaws. (ex: 5 points to merits + 5 points to flaws = 10 points)

Merits will act as "buffs" to the PC depending on the description of the merit. Flaws in turn will act as "de-buffs" to the PC depending on the description of the flaw. At different points throughout the campaign players will be asked to select from a new Merit and Flaw board which will be added below. Some of the Merits and Flaws mirror each other, when it comes to these you cannot pick one if you have picked the other. An example being if you choose for your character to have the Merit "Physically Fit" you cannot also select "Unfit" as they contradict each other.

Before making your decisions I would recommend having an idea of the kind of character you would like to play, these *will* depend on you actually following through with your decisions and they ***cannot*** be changed after you have locked them in. If you would rather build a character off of the decisions you make here that's fine as well, so long as you are certain that is what you want.
