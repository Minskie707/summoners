There are countless types of magical crystals, however there are a good bit that we know of. The crystals listed below have been the most common within mortal households. Their mundane uses have also been listed.


## Basic Crystals:

### Fire Crystals:

The crystal feels warm in your hand, swirling with different shades of orange and yellow. Fire crystals have a warm glow that shines from within, giving off dim light within a 10ft radius. These crystals are to be used in crystal hearths or crystal fire pits, the runes engraved in the stones will activate the crystal and give you the same effect of a crackling fire. Fire Crystals have been used in replacement to coal and fire wood for centuries. Although they’re not a main source of light anymore, fire crystals are still used within small lanterns, and in many cases, as a replacement to candles.

### Spirit Crystals:

The crystal has a soft magical hum to it, shining the same shade as a yellow citrine with an almost eerie lavender shimmer to it. Spirit crystals are used as a form of communication. They can be used to contact any living being, as long as you know their name; however it wont go through if they do not have a spirit crystal on their being. The crystals can be used to contact multiple people as well, commonly being used for meetings with those across the world. Spirit crystals, similarly to memory crystals can hold information, however spirit crystals hold thoughts; small pieces of information, a lot like short notes on things.

### Memory Crystals:

The crystal at base is a mix of swirling blues. When a memory crystal is activated it will have swirling silver strands almost floating within the crystal. An activated memory crystal will give off dim pale blue light within a 5ft radius, the light itself originates from the silver strands within. Memory crystals are used to store and view memories. The process for storing and viewing memories is different, to store a memory requires a difficult ritual. To store a memory, a full memory takes practice and a strong-willed mind. Viewing memories is the easy part, you can simply hold the crystal to view it yourself or place it within a viewing basin to project the memory.

### Health Crystals:

The crystal is a deep red color with shimmers of silver in the light. Health crystals are one of the most common crystal.
