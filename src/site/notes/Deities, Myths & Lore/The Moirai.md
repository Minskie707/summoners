## The Myth of The Moirai

---
In the annals of ancient times, when the world was woven from mysteries and the stars held secrets yet unspoken, there were three sisters known as The Moirai, the Oracles of Destiny. These three women, young in face yet timeless in spirit, were blessed—or perhaps cursed—with the ability to see into the future. Their prophecies foretold the fates of kings and commoners alike, drawing all who longed for answers into their elusive, ethereal presence.

The Moirai were daughters of an entity whispered only as "The Dust," a primordial force as ancient as the stars themselves. It was said that The Dust, a being older than light, gifted his daughters with visions that transcended mortal comprehension. They were beautiful beyond earthly measure, untouched by time’s decay, forever young. Legends claimed they dwelt in a hidden temple by the shore, where the mist met the sea, a haven for those desperate enough to risk their minds to gain knowledge of their future.

The eldest sister, Manin, possessed an aura of wisdom that none could deny. Her long black hair flowed like a raven’s wing, cascading down her fair skin. Her eyes, green as Spanish moss, held a thousand secrets, each one more haunting than the last. She saw the world with a knowing gaze, a gaze that pierced through lies and dreams alike. Many claimed her face held a warning all its own, as if to remind those who gazed upon her: _"The Moirai do not control your fate; they simply see it."_

The middle sister, Deimos, was a figure of warmth wrapped in mystery. Her curly brown hair tumbled down her shoulders, and her skin was kissed by the sun. But it was her eyes, icy blue as winter’s heart, that stilled the bravest of souls. She had the voice of a song yet unsung, one that inspired awe and fear in equal measure. Men, especially, were drawn to her, their eyes tracing her every move with longing. But Deimos’s gaze carried a reminder to those with foolish hearts, especially men who came too close, thinking themselves immune to destiny’s grasp: _"Seek not their beauty lest you be drawn into the web of your own fate, a fate that even The Moirai would dare not alter."_

Lastly, there was Eirene, the youngest of The Moirai, who seemed to walk between the realms of life and shadow. Her long silver hair glistened like moonlight upon the sea, and her skin was a pale canvas upon which her blood-red eyes blazed like embers. Eirene held a fascination with the ocean, and her words often flowed like waves, gentle yet foreboding. She watched the tides as one would watch the flow of time itself, whispering into the winds, _"To see one's fate is not to shape it. Beware, for The Moirai’s sight only brings the truths already woven."_

People from distant lands sought them, embarking on journeys that spanned years in search of their hidden temple by the sea. They came seeking glimpses of their futures, clutching at hopes, dreading the whispers of doom, and fearing the touch of destiny. The Moirai were known to speak with kings and beggars alike, each prophecy equal in its weight, for they neither favored nor despised.

One such king, Valen of Keatara, ventured to their temple on a moonless night. He was a king of ambition, fierce and proud, yet he held a strange dread in his heart, as if he sensed that his end lay upon him. It was said he knelt before The Moirai and begged for his future. The sisters, watching him with eyes both compassionate and cold, told him of a fate that would end in blood and ruin. Their prophecy became his doom, four days later, Valen was found slain, his kingdom cast into turmoil. From that moment, the tale of The Moirai grew more fearful, spoken in hushed tones, a tale to quiet restless children, and to haunt the hearts of kings.

Centuries passed, and stories of The Moirai became more myth than memory. Yet it was said that the sisters continued to dwell in their hidden temple, their eyes ever watching, ever seeing, untouched by the curse of time.

But then came a foreboding change. The Moirai, once resolute in their visions, began to grow troubled by a presence they named "The Dark Star." This was not a star of light, nor a star of guidance, but a being of immense destruction, one that existed beyond the reckoning of gods and mortals alike. With heavy hearts, they gave their final prophecy to the world:

_"Beware the night of falling light, seek not her salvation to ensure your destruction."_

With that last warning, The Moirai vanished, their temple by the sea abandoned to wind and salt. No mortal has since laid eyes upon them, but the legends persist. Some say they still wander unseen, veiled by mist, watching and waiting, hidden from the encroaching shadow of The Dark Star.

And so, the legend of The Moirai stands as both a tale of awe and a word of caution to those who still seek them, for their presence carries ancient wisdom, and their beauty is dangerous to desire.

_"The Moirai do not control your fate; they simply see it."_

_"Seek not their beauty, lest you be drawn into the web of your own fate, a fate that even The Moirai would dare not alter."_
