# **Warg Specialty**

_Summoning Discipline of [[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]]_

Wargs are the wild heart of Nightvale’s summoning traditions—archaic, untamed, and bound to rites far older than the academy itself. Where other specialties refine, modernize, and adapt, the Wargs cling to ancient rituals that call upon primal forces. This makes them the most mysterious and most feared of all summoners. To outsiders, Wargs appear feral, uncivilized, or even unclean; to those who understand their craft, they are a living echo of an era when summoning was raw, dangerous, and sacred.

## **Ritualists of the Old Ways**

Unlike every other discipline, Wargs have never abandoned the original rites through which summoning magic first entered the world. Their rituals are performed in moonlit circles, blood-marked stone, or wilderness untouched by civilization. These ceremonies are intense, visceral, and often unsettling to modern sensibilities.

But through them, Wargs channel a depth of magic few others can match.

## **Becoming the Beast**

The bond between a Warg and their summon is not a partnership or command structure—it is a **merging**. Wargs become one with their companions in ways considered taboo by present-day academia. Their emotions, instincts, and senses ripple between summoner and summon until the distinction blurs.

This connection allows Wargs to share thoughts, impulses, and visions through pure telepathy. Their summons do not merely obey; they _coexist_, often reacting before the Warg utters a word.

Scholars insist this level of fusion is dangerous. Wargs insist it is necessary.

## **A Shared Existence**

Among all specialties, Wargs hold the most intimate form of attachment. A Warg measures their life through the deeds of their summon, and a summon measures theirs through the Warg. Each victory, failure, triumph, and scar is shared.

Other summoners rely on magical translation to understand their companions; Wargs need no such intermediary. Their bond is instinctual, immediate, and overwhelming.

## **Philosophy of the Oath**

Wargs speak the oldest of all the summoner oaths:

### **“My companion is me.”**

It is not metaphor. To a Warg, the boundary between summoner and summon is a flexible, shifting line—one that may vanish entirely in moments of heightened power. Their identities bleed together, merging into something greater and more primal.

---

## **Public Perception**

Most summoners view Wargs with a mixture of awe and unease. Their chaotic nature, unrefined manners, and adherence to taboo rites lead many to dismiss them as brutish traditionalists. Rumors of failed bonds, ritual scars, and feral behavior do little to soothe this reputation.

Yet beneath their unruly exterior lies an unmatched dedication—to their summons, to their rituals, and to a way of life older than Nightvale Academy itself.

Wargs may be chaotic. They may be misunderstood.  
But they are never, ever weak.
