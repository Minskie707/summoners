The goddess of Magic and Memory. An entity all her own, she followed the flow of the stars on [[World History/The Night of Tau\|the Night of Tau]], following the other deities. She was said to have landed within [[World History/Palonia/Countries/The Shattered Isles\|The Shattered Isles]]. Remnants of her ancient temple lay there as a memory to her. The meteor that seemingly carried her was so large it broke the lands, shattering them. With her, however, came crystals of pure magical energy. Different colored crystals representing different things. It was a shame for mortals to hear of her disappearance, it was as if she simply vanished. Her symbols are moss agate and periwinkle flowers.
