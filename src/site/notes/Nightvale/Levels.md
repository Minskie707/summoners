The school’s ([[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]]) levels also known as the schools year rankings (ex: freshmen, sophomore, etc.) show a summoner’s personal progression. Failure is not an option, never has a student left the school due to them failing a level. The Academy holds a very tight line when it comes to progression, if you cannot live up to your potential, well no one knows what happens to those who don't live up to expectations. Summoners have reported students leaving when they cant meet the expectation of the headmistress, but no one has ever reported dropping out of the school. Graduation is when students are finally gifted the official title of Summoner, but until then they are referred to as their levels followed by their specialties. (ex: Procyon Hunter, Mizar Warg, etc. after graduating you’re simply a Summoner)

Once a student accepts the letter of invitation from Nightvale Academy, they accept that there is no failing out of the academy. You either die on the pursuit of becoming a Summoner or graduate to become a Summoner.

## Procyon:

Lowest on the food chain, Procyon's are first years. Commonly just trying to learn how to handle their newfound power. Their classes might seem the easiest and most redundant in comparison to the course load of the other levels. While in some cases that's true, most believe it to be the opposite. Considering the first years have no real idea on how to handle their new abilities, or how to use their summons effectively some say its the most difficult year. With some years, Procyons have been left to care for an egg when entering the school, it is in their best interest to protect that egg with all it might cost. Because of the eggs, Procyons are not allowed to leave academy grounds or contact outside the walls of the school for the first year.


## Mizar:

Second years, not much different from first years in their coursework. Although most think first year is the easiest, second tends to be the easiest year. Gaining only one class they certainly have a better chance of doing well in their coursework. Despite being allowed off campus, Mizars are not allowed to take job postings. For any sort of job you might feel the urge for, speak to the work administrator or see the board in the Mizar commons.


## Polaris:

Polaris tends to be where people start getting cocky with their abilities. Growing arrogant and egotistical as most summoners do as they progress. This year gains an exceptionally difficult class, one of magic. Though some might already be magic users, this class will not teach you anything of the ordinary population’s abilities. Polaris also comes with the privilege of taking jobs outside of the academy walls. However it is a privilege, meaning if you don't make it back before your allotted job leave is up you will lose this privilege for a time.


## Vega:

Vega is where most gain valuable experience in combat, as this is the year when [[Nightvale/Challenges\|Challenges]] start. Challenges make being a Vega exceptionally difficult and deadly, about half the level makes it to the next year. Though not all challenges are deadly, all are painful.


## Regulus:

Regulus is the fifth year, still having challenges. However this year comes with, arguably, the most exciting class. One that means to prepare you for the events that Regulus students are to participate in at the end of the year; [[Events & Festivals/The Summoners Gauntlet\|The Summoners Gauntlet]] and [[Events & Festivals/The Summoning Games\|The Summoning Games]]. These events will serve as a test of not only the students abilities as a summoner but the summons abilities and development as well.


## Sirius:

Sirius is the final year. This year is also when the challenges kick up a notch. Due to challenges the graduating class tends to dwindle, becoming much smaller than the first years. Making it to Sirius means you have almost mastered your abilities, some who make it to this level gain some special abilities.
