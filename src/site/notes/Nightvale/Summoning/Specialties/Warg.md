Wargs are archaic and chaotic. The most mysterious of the specialties, Wargs are seen as uncivilized and unclean. They are the only specialty left to gain their abilities through rituals. Just as the Hunters have their bonds so to do the Wargs. Wargs become one with their summons, something seen as taboo within the current times. Having a strong connection to their summons allows them to have a higher form of communication, being able to telepathically connect to their summons as apposed to the magical translation the other specialties have.

  

The Warg’s words are “My companion is me”, their oath refers to their connections to their summons. To a Warg, their summon’s accomplishments are their own, the reverse is also true.
