One of the first things a student will need to do upon entering [[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]] is choose a summoning specialty. These are important to knowing one's summoning abilities and becoming one with their summons. Each specialty is unique and comes with its own upsides as well as downsides. Specialties are better known for the abilities they give their summoners. While specialties are supposed to offer the same abilities across the board, some summoners are unique and have an uncanny ability to adapt their specialties abilities to better suit them.


Every specialty has a different form of connection to their summons. To go along side this each summoner has different words for their specialty, a sort of oath made by each summoner. In taking this oath to follow the words of your specialty, the summoner is gifted with abilities as they progress and show their dedication. In the case of [[Nightvale/Summoning/Specialties/Warg\|Warg]]s, traditional rituals are involved with the gifting of abilities, but to those who may find those unsavory, other specialties tend to get their abilities through dreams. All specialties are ruled by a different deity, but not all deities have specialties. That being said summoners are unlikely to see the deities often.


Taking the oath for your specialty is rather simple. You say your specialties words at their chosen altar, while in the presence of the head of the specialty. Then you preform the given ritual for your specialty, for most this is the only ritual required. The oath ceremonies take place towards the end of the students third day at the academy. Hopefully this gives the students enough time to become educated on the different specialties before making their decision.


An important thing to note is that summoning specialties are not what matter in team pairing at the academy, that being said multiple of the same specialties can be on the same team. Not all team members need to be unique or different in what they specialize in, having multiple of the same specialty is perfectly fine. **(that being said to avoid game breaking later in the campaign you can only have a singular duplicate per party)**

The specialties are as follows: [[Nightvale/Summoning/Specialties/Collector\|Collector]], [[Nightvale/Summoning/Specialties/Hunter\|Hunter]], [[Nightvale/Summoning/Specialties/Phalanx\|Phalanx]], [[Nightvale/Summoning/Specialties/Saor\|Saor]], and [[Nightvale/Summoning/Specialties/Warg\|Warg]].
