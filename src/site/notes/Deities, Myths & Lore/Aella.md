**Lore**  
Aella, Goddess of the Moon, is the youngest child of [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Calous\|Calous]], God of Death, and [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Atia\|Atia]], Goddess of Souls and Life. From her divine birth, she was destined to embody the balance between her parents’ domains—where endings meet beginnings, and darkness cradles the promise of dawn.

Though by birth the youngest of her celestial siblings—[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Rytar\|Rytar]], God of War; [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Nythar\|Nythar]], God of Glory; and [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Nutuna\|Nutuna]], Goddess of Youth—Aella carried herself with the poise and patience of an elder. Mortals and deities alike often mistook her solemn grace for age, and her wisdom became a guiding light to both kin and worshipper.

Aella is wed to [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Vearis\|Vearis]], the radiant God of the Sun. Together, they are said to govern the endless cycle of day and night, their celestial dance weaving the tides of magic and mortal time. From their divine union were born the triplets—[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Adone\|Adone]], [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Iros\|Iros]], and [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Sotar\|Sotar]]—each created from flowers imbued with their parents’ divine essence. These blooms remain sacred symbols within her temples, representing the eternal bond between moonlight, sunlight, and the dreams that bloom between them.

Though Aella once fled with her family during the age of divine upheaval, she did not remain in hiding. Her presence lingered in the night sky, a steadfast guardian who watched even when unseen. Yet for over a century, no mortal has laid eyes upon her. Her temples remain tended by devoted scribes who preserve her teachings and illuminate her shrines beneath the waxing and waning of her light.

**Worship & Teachings**  
Aella’s faithful revere her as the embodiment of balance, reflection, and endurance. Her clergy teaches that every ending holds a new beginning, and that wisdom is born not in light, but in shadow. Her rites are often performed under moonlight, with prayers spoken in silence, accompanied by offerings of silver ink or glowing starpetals.

Priests of Aella serve as keepers of memory, recording dreams, deaths, and destinies alike. To them, knowledge is sacred—an eternal flame carried from one life to the next. They believe that when Aella returns to the world of mortals, the moon will shine brighter than the sun for one night, and the stars themselves will sing in her honor.
