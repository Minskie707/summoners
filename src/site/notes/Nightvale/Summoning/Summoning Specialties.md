# **Overview of Summoning Specialties**

_The Paths of Bond, Power, and Identity at [[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]]_

Upon arriving at Nightvale Academy, every aspiring summoner faces their first—and perhaps most defining—choice: the selection of a **Summoning Specialty**. These disciplines shape how a student channels their magic, how they bond with their summoned companions, and how they grow over the course of their training. While all specialties share the same foundation of summoning artistry, each diverges sharply in philosophy, method, and form of connection.

A specialty determines not only the strengths and weaknesses a summoner will cultivate, but also the nature of their relationship with the beings they call forth. Some paths favor deep emotional bonds, others ritualistic unity, and still others strategic control or natural flow. No two specialties feel the same—and no two summoners walk their chosen path in quite the same way.

## **The Fluid Nature of Specialties**

Though specialties grant a unified set of abilities, students often exhibit unique adaptations. Some bond more deeply than their peers, channel power differently, or alter the specialty’s techniques to better suit their temperament. Nightvale instructors note that summoners with strong instincts—or strong wills—can subtly reshape their specialty’s gifts, creating results that stray beyond traditional expectations.

## **Bonds, Oaths, and the Source of Power**

Each specialty maintains a distinct connection style to its summons, ranging from emotional resonance to spiritual autonomy to primal fusion. In alignment with these bonds, every summoner swears a set of **Words**—a small but powerful oath that defines the specialty’s philosophy.

By speaking these Words and dedicating themselves to their path, students gain access to new abilities as they progress through the academy. Most specialties receive these gifts through dream-guided insight from their presiding deity, though the Wargs remain the sole practitioners of ancient rites and ritual empowerments.

Every specialty is governed by a deity tied to its origins. Though these patrons seldom appear—and rarely involve themselves with mortal affairs—their influence shapes each path’s abilities, expectations, and traditions.

## **The Oath Ceremony**

A summoner’s formal commitment takes place near the end of their **third day** at the academy, after ample time to study each specialty. The ceremony is simple but sacred:

1. The student stands before the specialty’s chosen altar.
    
2. The head of the specialty bears witness.
    
3. The student speaks their Words.
    
4. A brief ritual—unique to each specialty—seals the oath.
    

For most students, this is the only ritual they are ever required to perform. Wargs, however, continue to practice their specialty’s ancient rites throughout their training.

## **Teams and Specialty Composition**

Although a summoner’s specialty greatly influences their personal growth, it **does not** dictate team placement at the academy. Multiple summoners of the same specialty may serve on a single team, and diversity of specialties is not required.

_For gameplay and campaign balance, a party may include only one instance of any specialty duplicate (e.g., no more than two Hunters, two Saors, etc.)._

## **The Five Specialties of Nightvale**

Students may choose from the following disciplines:

- **[[Nightvale/Summoning/Specialties/Collector\|Collector]]** – Curators of diverse summons and tactical versatility.
    
- **[[Nightvale/Summoning/Specialties/Hunter\|Hunter]]** – Agile partners who forge deep, cooperative bonds.
    
- **[[Nightvale/Summoning/Specialties/Phalanx\|Phalanx]]** – Stoic summoners protected by powerful guardians.
    
- **[[Nightvale/Summoning/Specialties/Saor\|Saor]]** – Nature-touched dreamers who channel the earth through their summons.
    
- **[[Nightvale/Summoning/Specialties/Warg\|Warg]]** – Primal ritualists who merge minds and souls with their companions.
    

Each specialty offers a distinct path, a unique strength, and a different form of connection. Together, they form the backbone of Nightvale’s summoning tradition—and the first step on every student’s journey.
