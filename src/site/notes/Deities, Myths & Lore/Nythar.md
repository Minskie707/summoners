**Lore**  
Nythar, God of Glory, embodies the radiant pinnacle of effort—the moment when struggle becomes triumph, and battle gives birth to legacy. Born the twin of **[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Nutuna\|Nutuna]], Goddess of Youth**, and son of **[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Calous\|Calous]], God of Death**, and **[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Atia\|Atia]], Goddess of Souls and Life**, Nythar bridges the space between endurance and excellence. Where his elder brother **[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Rytar\|Rytar]], God of War**, represents the struggle itself, Nythar stands for the light that follows—the roar of victory, the immortal echo of a name remembered.

When the **Riot of Cholk** drove his divine family into exile, Nythar chose a different path. Disillusioned by mortal fear yet unwilling to vanish into obscurity, he journeyed west to **[[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]]**, the cradle of mortal ambition. There, he found purpose among warriors and scholars alike—becoming a living embodiment of the pursuit of greatness.

At Nightvale, Nythar serves as both mentor and measure. He oversees combat trials, guiding mortals not only to fight but to excel—to master the art of victory without succumbing to pride. The academy’s **Hall of Triumph**, a shining corridor lined with golden trophies and banners, is said to be his sacred space. To walk through it is to feel the pulse of his divine presence, warm and electric as sunlight after battle.

Though Rytar has not been seen since the fall of Cholk, Nythar often speaks of his brother as if he still feels him nearby. “He endures,” Nythar once said, “as all true warriors do.” Yet, he refuses to reveal more, guarding the secrets of his family with unwavering loyalty.

His **symbols are gold and trophies**, representing not vanity, but the eternal flame of perseverance rewarded. To earn glory under Nythar’s eye is to grasp a spark of divinity itself.

**Worship & Teachings**  
Nythar’s followers, known as **The Gilded Blades**, are knights, duelists, and champions who seek excellence through trial. They believe that glory is not a gift, but a forge—one that burns away weakness to reveal worth. Victory, to them, is sacred; not for dominance, but as proof of devotion, discipline, and honor.

His creed is carved upon the archway to the Hall of Triumph:  
_“Glory is the light earned through shadow. Stand tall, and let your name burn bright.”_

Clerics of Nythar serve as judges in contests, chroniclers of valor, and trainers to aspiring heroes. They wear golden adornments to honor his brilliance, and carry blades polished to mirror the light of their god. It is said that when a warrior fights with heart pure and purpose just, the shimmer that flashes upon their blade is Nythar’s gaze, watching proudly.
