**Fostrela — The Woodland Crown of Palonia**

Once part of the ancient realm of [[World History/Keatara\|Keatara]], **Fostrela** is a land of sweeping woodlands and towering mountains, where festivals ring through valleys and magic pulses in hidden groves. Its cities are strung along wide roads, easily reached by cart or caravan, but the deeper wilds belong to creatures and spirits seldom seen.

Fostrela holds a unique distinction among the nations of [[World History/Palonia\|Palonia]]: it is home to **[[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]]**, the world’s only magical institution, seated in the capital city of **Vixgate**. The Academy draws students, scholars, and adventurers from across the world, making Fostrela one of the most culturally diverse realms in existence. Yet beyond spellcraft and scholarship, Fostrela is alive with **festivals, night markets, and seasonal gatherings**, ensuring that even those without ties to the Academy find reason to visit.

The kingdom is ruled by **[[Noble Families, Important People, & Guilds/The Cynan Royal Family\|The Cynan Royal Family]]**, who preside from their ancestral seat in Vixgate.

**Agorith**

- _Climate:_ Freezing, snowy.
    
- _Notable Features:_ Violent ice sports, warrior culture.  
    On an island in the northwest lies Agorith, where snow and ice dominate both landscape and culture. Unlike the peace found in most of Fostrela, Agorith is steeped in **hatred for [[World History/Palonia/Countries/Abus (Ah-boos)\|Abus (Ah-boos)]]**, its neighbor across the sea. The people here keep their bodies honed and their spirits fierce, channeling their aggression into brutal **ice sports** that draw spectators from afar. Matches fought on frozen fields are as dangerous as any battlefield, and many Agorith champions are said to train as much for war as for play.
