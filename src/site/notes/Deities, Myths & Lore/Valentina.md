**Lore**  
Valentina, Goddess of Luck, is among the most beloved and widely invoked deities of the mortal world. Unlike many gods who dwell in distant sanctuaries, Valentina walks freely among her followers, choosing laughter and chance over solemn worship. She is a patron to gamblers, travelers, and dreamers alike—those who place their faith in fortune’s unseen hand.

Though counted among the divine who linger near [[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]], Valentina rarely sets foot within its austere halls. Instead, she resides in **Vixgate**, the heart of [[World History/Palonia/Countries/Fostrela (Fahs-trel-uh)\|Fostrela (Fahs-trel-uh)]]’s revelry and trade, where her temple doubles as a bustling guild hall. The temple hums with music, games of chance, and the murmur of hopeful prayers—though few can tell where devotion ends and delight begins.

She is often depicted as a radiant woman with ribbons in her hair and laughter in her eyes, her presence marked by sudden turns of fortune and fleeting good omens. Rabbits and clovers are her sacred symbols, and tales claim she holds a soft spot for **Harengons**, whom she considers her “little bringers of joy.” None know why she favors them so deeply, though some whisper they were once her messengers in an age long forgotten.

Valentina is confirmed to be sister to **[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Iana\|Iana]], Goddess of Jealousy**, though their bond is a complicated one. Where Valentina brings prosperity and serendipity, Iana kindles longing and envy. Mortals often say that the two are inseparable forces—one cannot be blessed with fortune without stirring the desire of another.

Despite rumors, Valentina and [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Aster\|Aster]] share no blood. Yet she seems fond of the stoic god of knowledge, occasionally visiting Nightvale’s archives to play harmless tricks—turning ink to glitter, or hiding his quills within tomes only she can find. When asked why, she once replied:

> “Because even wisdom needs a little chaos to remember it’s alive.”

**Worship & Teachings**  
Valentina’s faith is one of joy, courage, and risk. Her followers are encouraged to embrace opportunity, to step boldly into uncertainty, and to meet failure with laughter rather than fear. She teaches that luck favors the brave—and that fortune, once given, must be shared freely.

Her clerics, known as **Chancers**, travel widely, blessing crossroads and games of chance, or aiding those who have lost faith in their luck. Her shrines are rarely grand: a charm left on a tavern table, a painted clover on a caravan door, or a simple dice cup placed upon an altar.

It is said that when the winds shift suddenly or dice fall in your favor, Valentina has passed by—smiling, unseen, leaving only a whisper of laughter in her wake.
