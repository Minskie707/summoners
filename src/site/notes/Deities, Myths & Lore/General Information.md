**The Deities of Palonia**  
_Born of starlight and ruin, they fell upon the mortal world in a rain of fire, reshaping all that came before._

---

**Lore:**  
On [[World History/The Night of Tau\|The Night of Tau]], the heavens ignited in a storm of meteors—each one carrying within its heart a being of immense power. The falling stones burned the sky in radiant hues of violet, gold, and ember, their descent filling the air with strange, enchanting scents. In [[World History/Keatara\|Keatara]], witnesses spoke of the smell of old parchment and clover; in [[World History/Palonia/Countries/Estrye (Es-tray)\|Estrye (Es-tray)]], the perfume of wildflowers and the metallic tang of blood.

From these celestial vessels emerged the first deities—creatures of divine form and will. Their arrival wrought both wonder and devastation. Cities fell, forests burned, and the lands split apart. Mortals, terrified and furious, turned their wrath upon these beings from the stars. Yet the deities did not strike back. Instead, they rebuilt what they could, shaping homes, soothing storms, and coaxing beauty from ruin. Though they could not restore the dead or heal every wound, their gifts brought balance to the shattered world.

In time, gratitude overcame fear. Mortals raised monuments to their shining visitors, and in return, the deities gifted the mortal realm with _magic_—a spark of creation drawn from their own essence. For generations, this exchange bound gods and mortals together.

But harmony faltered. Understanding bred suspicion, and reverence turned to fear. The mortals who once worshipped the gods began to reject them, claiming they had overstepped. Many deities withdrew from mortal lands, retreating to realms unseen. Others lingered, weaving themselves into the fabric of society, and some—those seeking quiet purpose—found sanctuary within **[[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]]**, where divine power is studied rather than feared.

Those who remain often speak of one another as kin. Some are bound by true lineage, while others claim familial titles from long companionship. Their origins are still debated among scholars; though it is known that deities are capable of bearing children, most choose instead to create their offspring through divine artifice—binding life and magic as one.
