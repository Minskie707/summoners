**Lore**  
Atia, Goddess of Souls and Life, is the quiet pulse of the world—the rhythm of hearts, the breath that stirs the leaves, the whisper that calls souls back into being. Where her husband **[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Calous\|Calous]], God of Death**, tends to the end of the mortal cycle, Atia tends to its beginning. Together, they embody the eternal balance between death and renewal, though her gentle light often stands in contrast to his somber calm.

Unlike many deities of creation, Atia shuns grandeur and spectacle. She is a goddess of **peaceful beginnings**, of small miracles—the sprouting of a seed, the first cry of a newborn, or the reunion of a soul with its destined vessel. Her presence is said to fill mortals with serenity, easing grief and nurturing hope even in the shadow of despair.

Long ago, she dwelled in **Cholk**, a land said to be forever in bloom beneath her care. When a riot of faith and fear swept through her temples, Atia was **driven from her home**, her peace shattered by mortal conflict. In her grief, she fled into the unseen wilds, leaving behind two of her children to forge their own paths in a world that no longer welcomed her grace. None have seen her since that day, though fields that bloom out of season are said to mark her passing.

Atia is mother to **[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Rytar\|Rytar]], God of War**, the twins **[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Nythar\|Nythar]], God of Glory**, and **[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Nutuna\|Nutuna]], Goddess of Youth**, and her youngest daughter, **[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Aella\|Aella]], Goddess of the Moon**. She crafted them from her own blood mingled with the strength of the earth, each child born as an aspect of life’s growth—conflict, triumph, vitality, and renewal. Their father, Calous, gave each of them a shadow to temper that gift.

Her **symbols are newborn animals and saplings**, representing the fragility and endurance of life. Her followers often carry small charms of wood or bone, blessed in her name, to remind them that even the smallest spark of life deserves protection.

**Worship & Teachings**  
Atia’s temples are places of healing, birth, and quiet reflection. Her priests, known as **The Verdant Glass**, are midwives, herbalists, and caretakers of both body and spirit. They believe every life—plant, beast, or mortal—bears a fragment of her essence, and that all souls, once spent, will bloom again in her care.

Her doctrine is simple: _“To nurture is to honor her.”_ Acts of creation, protection, and compassion are her truest prayers. Violence and waste are her greatest taboos, for she abhors conflict born from pride or greed. Yet, despite her aversion to war, she understands that struggle sometimes births growth—and so she forgives, even as she mourns.

Atia is often invoked in childbirth, funerals, and during the planting season. When a child takes its first breath or a soul departs with grace, it is said that Atia is near, her unseen hands cradling the cycle she so tenderly preserves.
