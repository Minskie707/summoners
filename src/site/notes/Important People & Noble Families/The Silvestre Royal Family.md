The Silvestre royal family is a strong family within the north of [[World History/Palonia\|Palonia]]. Having branched from an old royal line, they’re true rulers to some. Ruling the lands of [[World History/Palonia/Countries/Abus (Ah-boos)\|Abus (Ah-boos)]] from the capital of Stextin. Their current name refers to a type of emerald found within the mountains of Abus, a rare gemstone only within their country. The family came to rule through somewhat of an election long ago. Despite what others might hear about them in other countries, the Silvestre family is known for being quite generous and overall very welcoming within Abus. One of the biggest lies told about the family is about their eldest daughter, Sira. In many other countries, it’s believed that Sira is not Onda’s child and is only Breixo’s, born to a woman who is not his wife. (which is frowned upon in Abus) While there is a small truth in this, Sira is neither’s child, she was adopted. Although Sira is the eldest by technicality, she has no legitimate claim or family tie to the throne of Stextin. Calisto is the blood-born heir to the throne.

King Breixo Silvestre, a large Frostborn Goliath with deep ties to an ancient bloodline too old for the history books. While Breixo can be cold and sharp like ice, he isn't without mercy, while the public would never dare say it to him his family often refers to him as the gentle giant. Ever so patient and passionate with his words, his voice has a booming quality to it, a voice that truly shakes the halls.

Despite being a kind king, he does not take kindly to insults towards him or his family, and his wrath knows no bounds when pushed past its limits. 

### Queen Onda Silvestre: The Silver Dragon

Queen Onda Silvestre, cool and calculated, she is a quiet shadow to Breixo. While some might expect the Ice King to be the cold one, it's quite the opposite, Onda holds a icy and cold stare, ever so observant and calculating. To outsiders, Onda seems rather standoffish, however to her people she is known to be rather caring. Despite her cold attitude, she is rather adapt at many arcane talents, she alone devised the plans for the forges used within Abus, building safer and stronger forges for her people to continue their work in safety.

Often times the Queen is accompanied by her handmaidens, as well as her daughters from time to time. On the rare occasions where she is seen with King Breixo, the public often cannot stop gossiping for days on end.
