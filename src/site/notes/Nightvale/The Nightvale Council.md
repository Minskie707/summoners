## The Nightvale Council

The Nightvale Council is the supreme governing authority overseeing [[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]] and the regulation of summoning within its jurisdiction. Operating without pause throughout the year, the Council exists to ensure that all laws, codices, and arcane restrictions tied to summoning, magical materials, and sanctioned artifacts are upheld as intended.

### The Grand Tower

The Council is housed within the **Grand Tower**, a colossal arcane structure situated at the edge of Nightvale Academy’s campus. The tower rises more than two hundred floors, its height and internal layout mirroring the Council’s rigid hierarchy.

- **Floors 1–187:** Administrative, operational, and enforcement levels.
    
- **Floors 188–199:** Reserved exclusively for the twelve Heads of the Council.
    
- **Floor 200:** The _Hall of Inquisition_, where matters of exceptional severity are judged.
    

From the outside, the Grand Tower pierces the clouds, its upper reaches surrounded by floating landmasses suspended by ancient magic. Within, the interior opens into a vast vertical chamber: tiered balconies spiral upward until solid floors seal the space beyond the hundredth level. Floating crystal arrays illuminate the tower in drifting bands of multicolored light, casting a constant, watchful glow.

A Warden is permanently stationed at the first-floor entry, and access beyond is tightly controlled.

### Authority and Purpose

The Council’s primary charge is the enforcement and interpretation of laws governing summoning and Nightvale Academy. Secondary to this is the regulation of magical items, materials, and restricted arcane practices.

While the Council maintains absolute authority over students during their enrollment, it intervenes only in matters of significant consequence. Minor infractions—such as uniform violations, dormitory disputes, classroom disruptions, or legacy privileges—are handled internally by the Academy. Severe breaches of the Codex, violations of international or tribal law, or acts that endanger others fall directly under Council jurisdiction. Students judged by the Council remain accountable to their home nations or tribes as well.

### Vega-Level Challenges

The Nightvale Council holds final authority over all **Vega-level Summoning [[Nightvale/Challenges\|Challenges]]**. Preliminary concepts and testing are conducted within the lower floors of the Grand Tower, but no challenge proceeds without approval from the Head Council.

In most cases, challenges are approved without intervention. However, if a proposed challenge—or the student assigned to it—draws the interest of the Head Council, a formal vote is convened. Such votes may determine:

- Whether a challenge proceeds unchanged or must be altered
    
- Whether the challenge is relocated off-campus
    
- Whether the student is deemed capable of undertaking it at all

### Council Structure

The Council is divided into **twelve sectors**, each governed by a single member of the Head Council. Every sector follows a strict pyramidal hierarchy, with authority flowing downward through clearly defined ranks.

**Nightvale Council Hierarchy (per sector):**

1. **Grand Councilor** – Sector Head and ruling authority
    
2. **Ascendant Councilors** (2) – Second-in-command and designated successors
    
3. **High Curators** (6) – Senior administrators and strategists
    
4. **Wardens** (24) – Tower enforcement and internal security
    
5. **Prefects** (120) – Campus oversight and field supervision
    
6. **Agents** (720) – Guards, investigators, and operatives
    

Agents and Prefects primarily serve throughout the Academy grounds, while Wardens are most often stationed within the Grand Tower itself.

### Secrecy and Composition

Much of the Council’s internal operation remains deliberately opaque to students and faculty alike. Its hierarchy, however, is common knowledge, serving as both warning and reassurance of the authority watching over Nightvale.

Though the majority of Council members are trained Summoners, approximately one-quarter of its ranks consist of individuals who have never awakened an Aspect and have never tested positive through Academy blood rites. Most of these individuals remain within the lower tiers, but rare exceptions exist. One such individual currently holds a seat among the twelve Grand Councilors—a fact quietly acknowledged and carefully guarded within the tower.
