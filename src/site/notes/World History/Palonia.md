# The World of Palonia

_“From the ashes of the Night of Tau, the world awoke — alive, luminous, and bound by magic.”_

Palonia is a world steeped in wonder and scarred by divine creation. Magic flows through its skies, its oceans, and the veins of every living thing — a force that was not always part of mortal existence.

According to nearly every faith and historical record, this power was born from **[[World History/The Night of Tau\|The Night of Tau]]**, a cataclysmic meteor shower that struck the world thousands of years ago. From those burning stones descended the first deities — beings of light and ruin who reshaped the land and left behind a world forever changed.

Each year, the people of Palonia celebrate **The [[Events & Festivals/Festival of Tau\|Festival of Tau]]**, honoring the divine birth and the spark of magic that still lingers in every corner of creation. From the frost-tipped peaks of Abus to the molten heart of the Dry Basin, the world thrums with Ether — the essence of raw, untamed power.

## The Lands of Palonia

Palonia consists of five great nations, each sprawling across its own continent and governed by its own ideals, bloodlines, and ancient legacies. Though connected by sea and story, their paths diverge as widely as their climates.

### **[[World History/Palonia/Countries/Fostrela (Fahs-trel-uh)\|Fostrela (Fahs-trel-uh)]] — The Woodland Crown**

_Capital:_ **Vixgate**  
_Ruling Family:_ **[[Noble Families, Important People, & Guilds/The Cynan Royal Family\|The Cynan Royal Family]]** (Patrilineal Monarchy)  
_Climate:_ Temperate to cold; warmest in Srico and Tront.

Once part of the lost land of Keatara, **Fostrela** is a realm of sprawling forests, glacial lakes, and silvery plains. The Cynan monarchy, proud and ancient, rules from Vixgate with strict tradition — power and succession always passing to the eldest son.

Fostrela’s people are industrious and ambitious, their open borders inviting scholars, merchants, and adventurers alike. Within its capital stands [[Nightvale/The Nightvale Council\|The Nightvale Council]], a governing body of magical and political power whose reach extends beyond the Cynan throne itself. As well as [[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]] a magical school of summoning.

_Capital:_ **Stextin**  
_Ruling Family:_ **[[Noble Families, Important People, & Guilds/The Silvestre Royal Family\|The Silvestre Royal Family]]** (Hereditary Monarchy, Eldest Heir)  
_Climate:_ Mild, with colder regions in Cholk and Panta.

Nestled among jagged peaks and vast caverns, **Abus** is the stony heart of Palonia. Its people prize strength and honor above all, believing that true power is earned through endurance and wisdom.

The **Silvestre Royal Family** has ruled since the founding of Abus, upholding ancient traditions of charity and protection. The kingdom’s borders are closely watched, yet its mountain forges and libraries are among the most advanced in the world.

### **[[World History/Palonia/Countries/Estrye (Es-tray)\|Estrye (Es-tray)]] — The Jungle Crown**

_Capital:_ **Nagos**  
_Ruling Family:_ **[[Noble Families, Important People, & Guilds/The Citrela Royal Family\|The Citrela Royal Family]]** (Matriarchal Monarchy)  
_Climate:_ Warm to hot; dense jungles with heavy humidity.

To the southeast lies **Estrye**, a lush and perilous land where towering trees and ancient ruins pierce the mist. The **Citrela Family**, descended from fae-blooded sovereigns, governs through wisdom, grace, and fierce conviction.

Estrye is a place of beauty and danger in equal measure — home to rare beasts, hidden temples, and the remnants of tribes who still guard the secrets of the old world.

### **[[World History/Palonia/Countries/The Dry Basin\|The Dry Basin]] — The Volcanic Exile**

_Capital:_ **Swiftstone**  
_Ruling Family:_ **[[Noble Families, Important People, & Guilds/The Alphus Noble Family\|The Alphus Noble Family]]** (Dictatorship)  
_Climate:_ Arid and hot; rain is rare and fleeting.

Once a desolate prison colony in the age of Keatara, **The Dry Basin** has forged itself into a kingdom of survival and control. The **Alphus Family** rules with an iron hand, their decrees absolute and unquestioned.

Black volcanic soil and burning winds shape the Basin’s people into traders, fighters, and survivors. Though its borders are closed, its ships still roam the seas — laden with heavily taxed goods and whispered secrets.

### **[[World History/Palonia/Countries/The Shattered Isles\|The Shattered Isles]] — The Archipelago of Dawn**

_Capital:_ **Hythe** (unofficial)  
_Ruling System:_ **Collective Anarchy / Self-Governed Communities**  
_Climate:_ Varies drastically between islands — Hythe is hot and dry, Valross temperate, and Edosa humid and lush.

A scattered realm of island chains born from the ruin of the Night of Tau, **The Shattered Isles** thrive without kings or crowns. Each community governs itself, bound by mutual respect and shared survival.

Here, invention and curiosity replace law and order. Artificers, explorers, and dreamers flock to the Isles to test the limits of magic and science alike — where the dawn of new discovery is constant, and the price of failure is often one’s life.
