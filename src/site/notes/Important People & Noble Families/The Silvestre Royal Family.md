The Silvestre royal family is a strong family within the north of [[World History/Palonia\|Palonia]]. Having branched from an old royal line, they’re true rulers to some. Ruling the lands of [[World History/Palonia/Countries/Abus (Ah-boos)\|Abus (Ah-boos)]] from the capital of Stextin. Their current name refers to a type of emerald found within the mountains of Abus, a rare gemstone only within their country. The family came to rule through somewhat of an election long ago. Despite what others might hear about them in other countries, the Silvestre family is known for being quite generous and overall very welcoming within Abus. One of the biggest lies told about the family is about their eldest daughter, Sira. In many other countries, it’s believed that Sira is not Onda’s child and is only Breixo’s, born to a woman who is not his wife. (which is frowned upon in Abus) While there is a small truth in this, Sira is neither’s child, she was adopted. Although Sira is the eldest by technicality, she has no legitimate claim or family tie to the throne of Stextin. Calisto is the blood-born heir to the throne.

When Sira was introduced to the people of Abus, many were confused, but who were they to judge their king and queen?
