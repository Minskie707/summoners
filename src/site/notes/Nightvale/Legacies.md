# **Legacy Students**

### **The Bloodlines of Summoners**

Students born into established **Summoner Households**—colloquially called _Legacies_—carry a [[Character Creation/Notoriety\|Notoriety]] that precedes them. These houses have cultivated their arcane traditions over generations, and their heirs arrive at [[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]] expected to uphold that heritage with unwavering precision.

Legacies are held to a stricter standard than their peers. Their triumphs elevate entire bloodlines; their failures stain names that have endured centuries. Some legacy houses wield near-mythic renown, their sigils whispered throughout the arcane world. Others carry notoriety of a different sort—rivalries, scandals, or ancient grudges that still fester beneath their polished exteriors.

Where two legacy heirs stand, history stands with them.

### **A Scholar’s Warning**

> _“A wise summoner seeking allies beyond their party should pay close mind to legacy disputes. When two legacies meet—two who disagree, or worse, who remember—nothing good comes of it for those caught nearby. Choose your place carefully, lest you be swept into a war that predates your birth.”_

### **Standards and Expectations**

Nightvale Academy demands that all legacy students exemplify the most disciplined interpretation of the **Summoner’s Codex**. Legacy heirs are expected to:

- Model decorum and discipline for the student body
    
- Maintain the dignity of their household name
    
- Avoid behavior that reignites ancient feuds
    
- Recognize that Nightvale’s hierarchy supersedes their family status
    

While a legacy name may command respect beyond the academy walls, **Nightvale is its own sovereign hierarchy**, governed by merit and council decree. Legacy pride is tolerated; legacy arrogance is not.

The academy encourages legacy students to temper generational rivalries. Past bloodshed has shown that old grudges rarely end with the heirs who inherit them.

### **Social Cliques and Legacy Influence**

In recent years, summoning students have formed increasingly distinct social circles beyond their assigned parties. Though many still keep to their party members, others treat their parties as formal obligations rather than true alliances.

This has given rise to:

- **Legacy-centered cliques**, where social status is measured by proximity to powerful houses
    
- **Political courting**, as non-legacy students seek favor or protection through legacy associations
    
- **Tensions within parties**, when personal loyalties conflict with party cohesion
    

Free time is often spent outside designated dormitories, as students navigate the unspoken social landscape shaped by legacy influence. Some seek prestige. Others seek protection. A few simply seek survival.
