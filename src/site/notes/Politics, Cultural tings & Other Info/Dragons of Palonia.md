### Dragons of Palonia

In Palonia, dragons are not the aloof and unchanging paragons of destruction that appear in most tales. Rather, they are living dynasties of adaptable creatures, bound by both instinct and ceremony, whose forms and temperaments shift to match their environment, their lineage, and their bond with mortals. To ride a dragon, or to be chosen as its summoner, is to enter a pact with a creature that stands between beast and legend.

#### The Dragon Hierarchy

Dragons live within colonies structured after primal instincts of dominance and survival. Each colony is led by a single Alpha, whose rule is determined by ritual combat. A dragon may only claim the mantle of Alpha by defeating the current leader. Should an Alpha die before combat can be held, the colony conducts a bloody ceremonial melee where challengers fight until one emerges victorious. Beneath the Alpha are Betas, who exhibit many of the same dominant traits without direct command, and Omegas, whose role is more submissive but no less vital to the health of the colony.

This hierarchy is absolute—regardless of the colony’s size, there is always only one true Alpha.

#### Growth and Molting

Unlike the chromatic and metallic dragons of common legend, Palonian dragons evolve as they age, their bodies reshaping in response to necessity. Their growth is marked by constant molting of scales, which occurs monthly until they reach adulthood.

- **Hatchling.** Newly emerged from eggs, these lizard-like creatures bear the same coloration as their shells. At this stage they are fragile and instinct-driven.
    
- **Wyrmling.** Roughly the size of a housecat, wyrmlings begin sprouting wings after their first molt. Their rapid growth is marked by monthly moltings, each revealing stronger scales and sometimes the first sparks of their emerging abilities.
    
- **Juvenile.** Comparable in size to a bull or warhorse, juveniles are highly emotional, volatile, and prone to rash behavior. Their wings grow to full proportion, and they begin exhibiting adolescent drives—including an instinct to mate.
    
- **Young Adult.** Mature in thought as well as form, young adults reach the size of a sailing vessel. Their personalities stabilize, and their bonds grow deeper.
    
- **Adult to Ancient.** Fully grown dragons continue their monthly molts until they reach true adulthood. The largest of their kind may rival mountain ranges in size.
    

Ordinarily, this growth spans centuries—sometimes millennia—but when bonded to a summoner, a dragon’s growth may be accelerated by magical rites, diet, or the summoner’s own advancement in power.

#### The Path of Growth

When a dragon bonds with a rider, its growth is no longer measured in centuries, but in steps walked alongside its companion.

- **Hatchling (your first steps).** Small as a lizard, curious and fragile. Your bond is young, but a spark has been lit.
    
- **Wyrmling (early trials).** Cat-sized, wings budding. First signs of flame, frost, or other breath stir within. It cannot yet bear you aloft, but it will try.
    
- **Juvenile (shared strength).** Grows to the size of a horse. Its wings stretch wide, and at last, you may ride. Its tail begins to shape itself into a weapon, though its moods are wild and fiery.
    
- **Young Adult (true kinship).** Towering like a ship, calm where once it raged. The dragon may mark you with a sigil of its choosing, granting you a gift of its power. Together, you act as one.
    
- **Adult (legend’s edge).** Your companion is vast, a shadow upon the land, wings like storm clouds. It may grant you a second mark, or even more, if your bond is unshakable. Few mortals ever walk this path to its end.

#### On the Dragon’s Mark

At times, a dragon may brand its rider with a shimmering scar or sigil. Such marks are not given lightly. They are gifts of trust, signs that your destinies have twined. The mark might grant hardened skin, keener vision, or even wings of your own for a fleeting time.

#### The Tail of Necessity

A dragon’s tail is no mere limb—it is a reflection of survival. Some end in venomous stingers, others in crushing clubs or blazing vents of fire. What shape your companion’s tail takes cannot be predicted, only awaited.

#### Warnings for the Chosen

- Should your heart falter, so too may your dragon’s. The bond cuts both ways.
    
- Dragons are not steeds—they are equals. They may carry you, but only if you carry their trust.
    
- The Alpha law lives within every dragon’s blood. If your companion is ever challenged by its kin, it may be forced to fight.
