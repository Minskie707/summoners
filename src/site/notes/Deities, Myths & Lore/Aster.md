**Lore**  
Aster, God of Education and Knowledge, is a quiet constant in the halls of mortal learning. He is said to dwell within the archives of [[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]], where his presence is so unassuming that many mistake him for a mortal scholar or humble scribe. In truth, he is the divine custodian of all recorded thought, the unseen hand ensuring that truth endures even as time seeks to erase it.

Though many claim he remains at Nightvale simply to tend to its vast library, the wise know his true purpose: to guard _The Forbidden section of [[Nightvale/The Archives\|The Archives]]_—a sealed chamber of ancient texts and dangerous knowledge bound by divine wards. Few who have attempted to breach its protections have returned, and those who have speak of a watchful presence in the dark, a calm voice that warns before silence falls forever.

Aster is rumored to share blood with [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Valentina\|Valentina]], Goddess of Luck, and [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Iana\|Iana]], Goddess of Jealousy, though such ties have never been confirmed. Unlike many of his kin, Aster has no interest in worship or reverence. He does not seek temples or praise, only the preservation of understanding. His symbols—books and scrolls—represent the pursuit of enlightenment and the burden of truth, for to know is to be forever changed.

Despite his divine nature, Aster is curiously mortal in manner. He walks among students and professors, always with a tome in hand, his gaze fixed upon its pages even as others speak to him. Those fortunate enough to gain his attention find him patient and precise, though never forthcoming about himself. He answers questions of study freely, but turns silent when asked of the divine, as though knowledge itself were his only true companion.

**Worship & Teachings**  
Aster’s followers are scholars, scribes, and seekers of truth—those who value understanding above all else. His faith is not one of prayer, but of practice. To study is to honor him; to record, to preserve, to question, is to walk his path.

His teachings warn that ignorance is the greatest corruption, and that truth must be wielded with wisdom. To hoard knowledge is to stagnate, but to reveal it without care is to invite ruin. Thus, his clerics and archivists act as both preservers and gatekeepers, ensuring knowledge is shared only with those prepared to bear it.

Shrines to Aster are rare and austere—simple desks or alcoves containing candles, ink, and an open book. His faithful say that when a lone page turns in still air, it is Aster himself continuing his endless work, ensuring that wisdom, once learned, is never forgotten.
