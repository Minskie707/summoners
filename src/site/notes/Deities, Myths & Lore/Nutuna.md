**Lore**  
Nutuna, Goddess of Youth, embodies the tender beginning of all things—the spark of wonder before wisdom, the purity before the world hardens it. Twin to **[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Nythar\|Nythar]], God of Glory**, and sister to **[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Rytar\|Rytar]], God of War**, and **[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Aella\|Aella]], Goddess of the Moon**, Nutuna stands as the youngest at heart among the children of **[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Calous\|Calous]]** and **[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Atia\|Atia]]**, gods of Death and Life respectively.

When the **Riot of Cholk** erupted, chaos tore through the divine and mortal alike. Her family fled the city in the storm’s wake, but Nutuna—small, radiant, and trusting—was left behind. Her mother wept to leave her, but fate and fury left no path open. The mortals, seeking comfort and purpose, turned to Nutuna as a symbol of hope amid ruin. They whispered lies into her young heart: that her parents had abandoned her, that her family fled to save themselves while she was left to perish. And, being young, she believed them.

Time passed, but Nutuna did not age as mortals do. Her innocence froze in divine amber, a child’s heart encased within eternity. The grief of betrayal gave her devotion a fragile beauty—she became both comforter and prisoner, worshiped by those who feared the cruelty of time.

Now, she is said to dwell within the **Temple of Blossoms** in **Panta**, high in the mountains of **[[World History/Palonia/Countries/Abus (Ah-boos)\|Abus (Ah-boos)]]**, where the stone walls breathe with life and vines bloom in eternal spring. The temple’s air smells faintly of lilies and rain, and its fountains sing lullabies to the lost and the young. The faithful say that those who die before their time are carried to her arms, reborn in her garden beneath the mountain.

Her **symbols are babies and budding flowers**, representing the beginnings of life and the promise of growth. Where her blessings fall, crops flourish, wounds close, and sorrow softens into new resolve.

**Worship & Teachings**  
Nutuna’s followers, known as **The Dawnborn**, devote themselves to healing, nurturing, and protecting innocence in all forms. They see the world as a garden that must be tended, and every act of care—a seed sown in her name.

Her faith emphasizes renewal: every mistake is a lesson, every heartbreak a chance to grow. Yet her clergy also carry a quiet sadness, aware that their goddess still waits for her family’s return, her heart clinging to a child’s faith in the goodness of others.

Clerics of Nutuna bless childbirths, spring plantings, and new ventures. Her temples are homes for orphans, the sick, and the lost. A whispered prayer to Nutuna is said to ease pain and bring gentle dreams.

Inscribed above her temple gates are the words:  
_“Even the smallest seed reaches for the sun.”_

**Myths & Rumors**

- **The Blooming Tears:** It is said that each spring, the mountain of Panta weeps dew at dawn—drops of Nutuna’s tears shed for the family she believes abandoned her.
    
- **The Twin’s Silence:** Though **Nythar** knows she lives, he dares not approach her temple. To see the grief he caused, he claims, would turn his glory to ash.
    
- **The Eternal Child:** Mortals believe that one day, should her family return to her and truth be restored, Nutuna will finally age—her eternal youth giving way to divine wisdom, marking the rebirth of harmony between gods and mortals.
