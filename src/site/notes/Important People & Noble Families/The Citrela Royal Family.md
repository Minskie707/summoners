## The Citrela Royal Family of Estrye

As ancient in name and blood as the Cynans of [[World History/Palonia/Countries/Fostrela (Fahs-trel-uh)\|Fostrela (Fahs-trel-uh)]] and the Silvestres of [[World History/Palonia/Countries/Abus (Ah-boos)\|Abus (Ah-boos)]], the Citrela Royal Family descends from a noble line of fae-blooded sovereigns long entwined with the mystic roots of the old world. Their seat of power lies in the verdant peninsula city of **Nagos**, where their estate—**Crownbranch Hold**—rises like a living monument at the forest’s edge, its towering spires wrapped in sprawling limbs of tree and ivy, as though grown by the will of the wilds themselves. Here, beneath the canopies of magic and moonlight, the Citrelas have ruled with open hands and warm hearts.

While among the wealthiest of the royal bloodlines, the Citrelas are known across the realm for their unwavering generosity. Queen Nyssa’s vision has turned Nagos into a beacon of prosperity, with **grand community halls, a vast public library rivaling even [[Nightvale/The Archives\|The Archives]]**, and bustling taverns where food and drink are often priced for the common folk. No soul goes hungry within [[World History/Palonia/Countries/Estrye (Es-tray)\|Estrye (Es-tray)]] if the Citrelas can help it—for at the Queen’s command, the palace holds an **open table**, where all may eat who cannot feed themselves.

### Queen Nyssa Citrela

**“The Hearth of Estrye”**  

Crowned at just nineteen upon the untimely fall of her mother, **Queen Nyssa Citrela** inherited not only a throne but a fractured realm. Beset by raiders along the borderlands and chaos from island outposts, her people cried out for hope—and she answered. Through tireless diplomacy, coordinated defenses, and sweeping public works, Nyssa has woven Estrye into a resilient and unified land. Beloved by her people, she is known to walk the streets without escort, speaking to bakers and builders alike. Where others rule with fear or fire, Nyssa rules with **compassion and conviction**.

### Princess Juniper Citrela

**“The Watchful Rose”**  

The eldest child and **heiress to the Citrela throne**, at sixteen **Princess Juniper** bears the weight of expectation like a crown of thorns. With every glance and whispered courtly rumor trained upon her, she steps carefully through a life not fully her own. Set to attend **[[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]]** in the coming season, the young princess welcomes the escape that academic study may bring—despite her lukewarm fondness for books. While quiet and guarded in demeanor, there is a spark of subtle defiance in her: **a desire to shape her own story, not just inherit it.**

### Princess Melina Citrela

**“The Song of the Greenwood”**  

Younger than Juniper by a year, **Princess Melina** has captured the hearts of Nagos not through diplomacy or doctrine, but through song. Her voice, often likened to a divine chorus, is whispered to be **a gift from the gods themselves**. Though shy of the spotlight, her acceptance into **Nightvale Academy a year early** sent murmurs through the city. Few expected her to walk the same halls as her elder sister so soon, yet her quiet brilliance—particularly in both academics and performance—marks her as a rising star, even if she doesn’t yet know it.

### Prince Ashen Citrela

**“The Ember Ward”**  

**Prince Ashen**, youngest of Queen Nyssa’s children, has found his calling not in courts or councils, but in **the arcane sigils of protection and warding**. While his sisters study statecraft and diplomacy, Ashen pours over glyph work, learning how to weave magic into circles that repel, shield, and strike. His instructors whisper of his rare focus, of his **aptitude for runes beyond his years**.

Now, with **[[Politics, Cultural tings & Other Info/Etherling\|Etherling]]s pressing from the west**, his lessons have turned from theoretical to essential. Ashen has seen the twisted aftermath of [[Politics, Cultural tings & Other Info/Ether\|Ether]]'s curse—how it eats the soul before the body, transforming kin into clawed horrors. He trains not for pride, nor glory, but for necessity. For if the cursed things breach the forests near Nagos, **it may fall to Ashen and those like him to defend the realm where steel alone may fail.**
