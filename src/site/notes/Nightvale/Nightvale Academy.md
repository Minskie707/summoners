### **✦ Nightvale Academy ✦**

Nightvale Academy appeared without warning—an arcane marvel that rose from the earth on the [[World History/The Night of Tau\|The Night of Tau]], complete with its headmistress and faculty. Towering spires of gothic stonework claw toward the sky, bound to the land by ancient roots and ivy, as though the very earth refuses to release it. To the common eye, the craftsmanship appears masterful; yet to a seasoned stonemason, it is something else entirely—no mortal hands could have carved stone so precise, so flawless. It is as if the academy was hewn from the bones of the mountain itself.

The city of [[World History/Palonia/Countries/Fostrela (Fahs-trel-uh)\|Fostrela (Fahs-trel-uh)]], seat of the Vixgate Kingdom, received the academy’s arrival with strange acceptance. Records held in the Cynan Historic Library speak in unison of that night. Every account bears the same phrase: _"The school grew out of the ground."_ Beyond these entries, little is known. The academy remains shrouded in mystery—its halls silent, its students content, and its secrets well-guarded.

Nightvale’s curriculum is structured across six ascending [[Nightvale/Levels\|Levels]] of arcane and scholarly development: **Procyon**, **Mizar**, **Polaris**, **Vega**, **Regulus**, and the final tier, **Sirius**. Each student begins their training at the Procyon level, regardless of background or prior skill.

The grounds themselves are rumored to be alive. Locals whisper that the vines upon the building shift when unobserved, that the academy listens, watches, and remembers. But the greatest mystery of all is the headmistress—**Caipra Ilea** of [[Noble Families, Important People, & Guilds/The Ilea Family\|The Ilea Family]]. It is said she once ruled Vixgate in an era long past, and some claim she still does, wielding her influence from the academy’s shadowed halls. Rumors persist that her daughter is betrothed to the Crown Prince of Vixgate, a union forged in secret to maintain peace between the Academy and the Crown.

Most dare not question Nightvale’s affairs, for fear of the headmistress’s wrath. [[Nightvale/The Nightvale Council\|The Nightvale Council]]—an enigmatic governing body—now enacts laws observed even by [[Noble Families, Important People, & Guilds/The Cynan Royal Family\|The Cynan Royal Family]] and its guard. Though Nightvale has never acted in open hostility, its autonomy is unquestioned and uncontested.

**✦ Admissions & Arrival ✦**

Each year, on the day following the Feast of the Moon—the first of Nightal—Nightvale accepts a new class of students. Entry is determined by arcane testing of blood samples collected in early spring by cities and kingdoms across the realm. Those deemed worthy receive letters of acceptance two months prior to their arrival.

Students journey to Nightvale by airship, river barge, or caravan, arriving on the dawn of Nightal. They are granted the morning to explore Fostrela’s city streets, but by midday, they must report to the Academy gates to undergo their first rite: initiation into Summoning magic.

For their own protection, all first-year students are forbidden from leaving the grounds until their training advances.
