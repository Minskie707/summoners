Hunters are agile and fast. There are legends of Hunters who move fast enough to vanish right in front of you. When a Hunter first gains contact with their first summon its said they feel a strong desire to protect them. Hunters and their summons have special bonds, each unique and individual to each summon. As a Hunter, summoners can bond with their summons to gain a deeper connection to them. But just as each bond to their summon is unique, the way they bond with each summon is also unique. The higher of a bond a Hunter has with their given summon may aid in unlocking abilities for their summon. 


The Hunter’s words are “My companion is my friend”, their oath refers to the bonds they hold with their summons. Hunters are loved by many, having an air to themselves that seems to attract those around them.
