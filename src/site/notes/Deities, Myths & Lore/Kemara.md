The goddess of Sleep. She stays within the walls of the [[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]], becoming close to the headmistress. Although she was never spurned by the mortals, she felt as though some of the other gods had overstepped and has since grown to dislike her fellow deities. She’s believed to be related to [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Calous\|Calous]] and [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Vearis\|Vearis]], though it’s never been confirmed that she’s related to either of them. Her symbols are poppies, it’s said that when she walks along the grass blue poppies bloom at her feet.

Kemara's parents are unknown. She is believed to be related to Calous god of death and Vearis god of the skies however this has not been confirmed.
