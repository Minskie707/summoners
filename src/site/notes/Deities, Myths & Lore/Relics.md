While relics have been written of in history and have been known to exist, all relics have seemingly *disappeared*, having been over five centuries since the last time a relic was accounted for. Many mortals believe that long ago, after [[World History/The Night of Tau\|The Night of Tau]] a [[Deities, Myths & Lore/War of Faiths\|War of Faiths]] broke out between the gods. Although there are a few historical accounts of a dispute, most regard it as little more than a family feud rather than a war. One written text tells a story of the so called "War of Faiths", but it is to be regarded as just that, *a story*. 

Each relic has a story behind its creation, as well as a story for each of its most prominent users. However each seem to start with a deity going to [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Cilleth\|Cilleth]] for assistance. The magic he wields within his forge has made each relic to the specifications given by the deities. While Cilleth forges the relics for the deities, they tend to embellish them with their own *"flair"* if you will.
