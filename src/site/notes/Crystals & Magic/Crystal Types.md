# ✦ Crystal Magic of Palonia

> _“A single shard of crystal hums with a thousand possibilities. Listen closely enough, and the world might sing back.”_  
> — Archmage Liora of the Aurum Index

Crystals are one of the oldest and most versatile magical resources in [[World History/Palonia\|Palonia]]. Each resonates with a unique frequency of the Weave, channeling divine, elemental, or spiritual energy. Though hundreds of varieties exist, the following are among the most common and most studied.

Crystals are categorized into **Basic** and **Advanced** tiers.  
Basic crystals are commonly available to households, artisans, and mages.  
Advanced crystals, however, are heavily restricted—often requiring state sanction or academic license due to their volatility or moral implications.

## Basic Crystals

### Fire Crystal

_Elemental — Heat, Light, Sustenance_

Warm to the touch and glowing with swirling hues of amber and gold, a fire crystal radiates dim light in a 10-foot radius. When engraved with runes and set in a hearth or brazier, the crystal ignites with steady heat and the gentle crackle of flame.

Once the foundation of Palonian homes, fire crystals replaced coal and firewood centuries ago. Though now largely supplanted by newer light sources, they remain favored for travel lanterns and ceremonial fires.

---

### Spirit Crystal

_Communicative — Mind, Connection, Voice_

Spirit crystals shimmer with the golden hue of citrine and a faint lavender sheen. They emit a soft hum when attuned to a user’s aura. Two spirit crystals linked by name allow telepathic communication across vast distances, though a message fails if the recipient lacks a corresponding crystal.

They can also store thoughts and mental impressions—short notes of memory or intention—making them invaluable to scholars, diplomats, and guild leaders who meet across continents.

---

### Memory Crystal

_Cognitive — Recall, Vision, Record_

A swirling blue crystal that, when activated, fills with drifting silver strands of light. When held, it emits pale blue dim light in a 5-foot radius.

Memory crystals can **store** or **replay** lived experiences. Recording a memory requires a precise and mentally taxing ritual—only the strong-willed can preserve full recollections. Viewing stored memories is simple: hold the crystal to your temple to see them privately, or place it within a **viewing basin** to project the scene into the air.

---

### Health Crystal

_Vital — Restoration, Pulse, Renewal_

These deep crimson crystals glimmer with threads of silver. When crushed or activated, a health crystal releases a rejuvenating pulse that restores vitality to nearby allies.

> **Game Use:**  
> As an action, a creature can activate a Health Crystal, healing friendly creatures within 15 feet for **2d8 + 4 hit points**. The crystal then dissolves into inert dust.

Their simplicity and reliability make them a common tool among healers, adventurers, and royal guards alike.

---

### Ice Crystal

_Elemental — Preservation, Cold, Stillness_

Cold to the touch and faintly glowing blue, an ice crystal coats nearby surfaces in frost. When placed inside insulated containers, it keeps perishable goods preserved far longer than mundane ice.

Ice crystals do not melt and can remain cold indefinitely, making them invaluable to traders, healers, and alchemists who must travel long distances.

---

### Light Crystal

_Radiant — Illumination, Purity, Sight_

As luminous as polished quartz, a light crystal glows with steady brilliance, casting **bright light in a 30-foot radius** and **dim light for an additional 15 feet**.

These crystals illuminate mines, temples, and noble estates. While technically a basic crystal, light crystals are among the most expensive due to their rarity and enduring glow. In some regions, they serve as symbols of wealth and divine favor.

---

## Advanced Crystals

> _“The higher the resonance, the greater the risk. Handle these without wisdom, and they will handle you in return.”_  
> — Uril Goddess of Magic and Memory

Advanced crystals are rare, powerful, and often restricted to government, military, or academic use. Mishandling one can cause catastrophic magical feedback—or worse.

---

### Gravity Crystal

_Elemental — Motion, Weight, Flight_

Resembling deep amethyst, gravity crystals emit a faint violet glow that bends dust motes around them. When installed in specialized **gravity chambers**, these crystals generate controlled levitation fields.

They power the legendary **airships** of Palonia, keeping their hulls suspended in the air. However, raw gravity crystals are **illegal to operate without a sanctioned chamber**, a law decreed personally by **[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Uril\|Uril]], Goddess of Magic and Memory**.

Unauthorized use has led to devastating accidents—and swift divine retribution.

---

### Life Crystal

_Vital — Resurrection, Rebirth, Continuance_

A life crystal gleams deep red, shot through with golden flecks. Often found in the packs of seasoned adventurers and Summoners, these crystals can restore life to the fallen.

> **Game Use:**  
> As an action, a creature can shatter a Life Crystal over a corpse that has died within the past minute. The creature returns to life with **3d8 + 4 hit points**, and the crystal crumbles to dust.

Due to their rarity and potency, life crystals are worth fortunes and are often traded only under strict guild supervision.

---

### Containment Crystal

_Arcane — Prison, Soul, Stasis_

A smoky, semi-transparent crystal with a hollow, shadowed core that seems to shift when turned. When properly activated, a containment crystal can **trap a creature or soul** within its inner void. The captive appears in a dreamlike, hibernating state, surrounded by swirling colored mist—their very essence, according to Uril.

Use of these crystals is **highly regulated**. They are reserved for extreme threats or divine mandate.

Before restrictions were imposed, **Minor Containment Crystals** were once used to bind only a creature’s soul—often as punishment. The bound spirit would serve the state or noble house in servitude until its sentence was fulfilled, a practice now considered unethical and outlawed in most kingdoms.

---

### Surveillance Crystal

_Divinatory — Vision, Awareness, Control_

These rounded black stones resemble polished obsidian. When socketed into rune-inscribed metal fittings, they serve as magical recording devices.

A network of surveillance crystals relays sound and image to a larger **mother crystal**, which stores or displays the information in real time.

Such systems are used in city watchtowers, noble estates, and public halls—though the ethics of constant magical observation are hotly debated across Palonia.

---

## The Ethics of Crystal Use

Crystals embody both progress and peril. They have raised cities, healed the wounded, and powered wonders once thought divine. Yet with each discovery comes greater moral weight—questions of life, privacy, and the soul itself.

As the Aurum Index warns its apprentices:

> _“The brilliance of a crystal blinds those who stare too long.”_
