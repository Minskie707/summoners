[[World History/Palonia/Countries/Abus (Ah-boos)\|Abus (Ah-boos)]]: Snow
[[World History/Palonia/Countries/Estrye (Es-tray)\|Estrye (Es-tray)]]: Vine

Although orphans might be located everywhere, there aren't orphanages in every town. However every capital houses at least one orphanage. The kingdoms and people of the capital housing the orphanage are to provide one of the basics to assist in caring for the orphans, this can include, food, clothes, blankets, or in some rare cases toys are accepted instead. Despite the call for assistance in taking care of the orphans, many orphanages are left with barely enough to care for those it houses.

Orphanages being placed within every capital was under the ruling of [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Nutuna\|Nutuna]] the Goddess of Youth. She wanted to ensure that there would be at least a bed, maybe some bread and fresh clothes for every orphan, a way to help the orphans who could not make it to her temple all the way in Panta. Though most orphanages are struggling to get by, the ones located in Abus are almost thriving. [[Noble Families, Important People, & Guilds/The Silvestre Royal Family\|The Silvestre Royal Family]] make sure enough funds are allocated to the main orphanage in Stextin and Nutuna over sees the care for those at her temple in the mountain.
