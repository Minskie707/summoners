## Count Karken Spiros of Cholk

**“The Vintner of Secrets”**

A name spoken in velvet tones and raised goblets, **Count Karken Spiros** holds a unique place among the nobility of **[[World History/Palonia/Countries/Abus (Ah-boos)\|Abus (Ah-boos)]]**. Though his lands and influence are fit for a **Duke**, and his wealth rivals that of minor monarchs, Karken chooses the humbler title of "Count"—**a calculated affectation**, born of vanity and enigma. A **periwinkle-hued tiefling** of striking appearance and silvered tongue, he dwells in the opulent wine-country city of **Cholk**, where his sprawling estate lies nestled among endless vineyards.

Karken’s fortune flows as freely as his wine, amassed through a potent blend of **commerce and whispered leverage**. He is the proud owner of one of the most prestigious wine companies in all [[World History/Palonia\|Palonia]], his signature blends gracing tables from royal banquets to clandestine councils. Beneath his estate runs a labyrinthine warren of cellars and tunnels—**a place of casks and secrets**, where more than vintage may be stored.

Though the court of Abus is rife with gossip and intrigue, few dare to speak ill of Spiros. It is commonly understood: one does not insult the man who flavors your cup. There are murmurs, of course—**rumors long buried** of **forbidden summoning pacts**, **letters from [[Nightvale/The Nightvale Council\|The Nightvale Council]]**, and even **brushes with the divine**—but such tales are usually dismissed with a toast and a knowing smile.

In public, Karken is all charm and spectacle, his persona wrapped in silk and scent. Lavish galas, seasonal feasts, and exclusive tasting events mark the Cholk social calendar. Yet this year, a **peculiar deviation** has drawn new eyes: an unscheduled, uncharacteristic gathering known only as **"[[Events & Festivals/The Procyon Showcase\|The Procyon Showcase]]."** For the first time, a rare few **Procyon students—first-years of [[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]]—will be permitted beyond the veil of their training to perform before an elite and curated audience**. Whispers say the Count has a hand in their selection. Others wonder if the event is **a performance, a test, or something more arcane**.
