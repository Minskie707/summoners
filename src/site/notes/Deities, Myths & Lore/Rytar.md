**Lore**  
Rytar, God of War, is the eldest son of **[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Calous\|Calous]], God of Death**, and **[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Atia\|Atia]], Goddess of Souls and Life**—the first flame born of their union of stillness and vitality. In him, the cycle of life and death manifests as conflict: the clash that forges purpose, the struggle that brings growth, the battle that tempers the soul.

When mortals turned upon his parents in the **Riot of Cholk**, Rytar’s fury shook the heavens. He demanded blood for blood, vengeance for peace betrayed. But his mother forbade it, and her plea stayed his hand. Though the fire of his wrath burned still, Rytar chose obedience—a choice that cost him greatly. He followed his parents into exile, serving as their shield and watchful blade as they vanished from mortal lands.

Since that night, **no mortal has seen Rytar**, though his presence endures in whispers across the battlefield. Soldiers speak of a figure cloaked in crimson mist who walks among the dying, granting strength to those who fight for purpose and turning away from those who kill for pride.

Rytar’s connection to his brother **[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Nythar\|Nythar]], God of Glory**, remains unbroken—two halves of the same ideal. Where Nythar craves triumph, Rytar embodies endurance; one shines in victory, the other bleeds through failure. His other siblings are **[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Nutuna\|Nutuna]], Goddess of Youth**, and **[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Aella\|Aella]], Goddess of the Moon**, whom he guards fiercely, even from afar.

His **symbols are blood and swords**, emblems of sacrifice and resolve. To his followers, blood is not a mark of cruelty but of cost—the price of survival, of duty, of meaning.

**Worship & Teachings**  
Rytar’s faithful, known as **The Crimson Host**, are warriors, guardians, and survivors bound not by conquest but by endurance. They believe that to fight is not to destroy, but to preserve what must endure. His doctrine teaches that rage is not a curse but a burden to master—a weapon that cuts both ways.

His tenets are carved in the War Priests’ Creed:  
_“To bleed is to live. To rise again is to honor him.”_

Temples to Rytar are rare; most of his worship occurs on battlefields and in war camps, where his name is invoked over the wounded and the fallen. Offerings of steel and blood are given before battle, not to beg for victory, but to prove worth.

Those who call upon Rytar seek not glory, but endurance—the strength to stand when others fall, to keep fighting when all hope seems lost. And when the final breath leaves their lips, they believe it is Rytar’s hand that carries their soul to Calous’s waiting embrace.
