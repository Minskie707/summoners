The goddess of the Moon. Aella is the youngest of her siblings in technicality, however she's always acted as though she was the oldest. To many she looks like a darker form of her mother, [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Atia\|Atia]]. She is married to [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Velo\|Velo]], and has her triplets; [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Adone\|Adone]], [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Iros\|Iros]] and [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Sotar\|Sotar]]. Her and Velo had made them using magically imbued flowers, each staying as a part of their childrenâ€™s symbols. Although she fled along side her parents and brother, she did not stay hidden away with them. Even still, no mortal has seen her in over a century; her temples kept maintained by the scribes who have dedicated their lives to her service. Her symbols are the moon and the stars.
