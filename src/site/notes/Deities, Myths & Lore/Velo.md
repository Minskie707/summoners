**Lore**  
Velo, God of the Sun, stands among the most venerated of the celestial pantheon. Born from the divine union of [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Amros\|Amros]], Goddess of the Seas, and [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Vearis\|Vearis]], God of the Skies, he is the only deity known to have entered the world through natural birth rather than divine creation. This alone marks him as unique among the second generation of gods, and many sages claim it is the source of his unmatched strength and endurance—though such claims remain unproven, even by the gods themselves.

From his earliest days, Velo was a figure of warmth, vitality, and boundless energy. His radiance was said to give life to the fields, his laughter to scatter storm clouds. Yet despite his brightness, Velo’s heart was tempered by restraint and wisdom. In his union with [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Aella\|Aella]], Goddess of the Moon, he found his perfect counterpart—their harmony defining the balance between day and night.

Together, the divine pair brought forth their children: [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Adone\|Adone]], [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Iros\|Iros]], and [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Sotar\|Sotar]]. Rather than through mortal birth, the triplets were born from flowers infused with divine magic, each blossom touched by Aella’s moonlight and Velo’s sunlight. Though Velo had wished his beloved to carry the children to term, he honored her decision, blessing the blooms that would cradle their divine essence.

In the centuries following their disappearance, Velo has withdrawn from the divine gatherings. Mortals who visit his great temple in Vilco—his shining seat within [[World History/Palonia/Countries/Estrye (Es-tray)\|Estrye (Es-tray)]]—find the god solemn and silent. He speaks little of his wife or their missing children, and though the sun still rises each day, its light has grown softer, as if dimmed by longing.

**Worship & Teachings**  
Velo’s faith is one of renewal, honor, and steadfast duty. His priests teach that the light of truth must be carried into all darkness, and that strength without compassion burns hollow. His followers include farmers, soldiers, and travelers who hold a certain affinity for the suns light.
