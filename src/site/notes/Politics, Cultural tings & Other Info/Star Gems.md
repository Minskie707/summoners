Star Gems, far rarer than their mundane counterparts. These wonderous gems were found long ago, deep within caves of different countries, shimmering gemstones were found where there had originally been nothing but stone. These gemstones were dubbed Star Gems due to the shimmering glow they emitted, many associated the shimmer to that of starlight. Originally these gems were used for nothing more than jewelry for the high society, however as their popularity grew, some had discovered that when they wore a certain type of Star Gem that they were gifted with helpful benefits. When this was investigated further it was found that those who shared the same type of star gem also shared the same birth month, so many began associating the stones with their birth months.

The accordance of the months went as follows:

| Month     | Star Gem(s)                                                                                  | Description(s)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Star Gems resonate most strongly with those born under their corresponding month. When used as a **spell focus** or **enchantment core**, they amplify the wielder’s innate magic. Advanced enchanters also use them to **store spells** or **infuse weapons and armor**, crafting heirlooms of rare power. However spellcasters are not the only ones who may benefit from the use of Star Gems, while spellcasters may more commonly carry these gemstones they can be used for more than spells. Since their appearance various uses have been found for them, however these have been limited due to the scarcity of these gems. A talented young Artificer made many of the advancements in utilizing these gems to be more than simple accessories, unfortunately before many of these advancements could be finalized the Artificer disappeared.

Unfortunately not all Star Gems have been found to hold the same quantity, some have been found less often or are simply too deep to reach within the caverns. Due to the fluctuation of the rarity of these gems their price can range greatly and their availability is scarce.
