The Summoner’s Codex is in its simplest form, a set of rules and suggestions. Rules that all students must abide by at [[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]]. The Codex shall be as important as the students' holy grounds. Breaking the Codex leaves students to [[Nightvale/The Nightvale Council\|The Nightvale Council]]’s decisions, to ignore a direct summon by the Council is punishable by execution. The Codex is as follows:
 

### **General Conduct**

- **Non-Lethal Intent**: It is prohibited to harm another party member with the intent to kill.
- **Respect for Rest**: Attempting to kill someone in their sleep is strictly forbidden.
- **Settle Matters in Combat**: Personal matters should be resolved on the combat mat in the pit. There will be no bloodshed in the halls.
- **No Exemptions**: No one, not even a legacy, is exempt from punishment.

---

### **Assignments and Authority**

- **Priority of Assignments**: Assignments given by the Headmistress take precedence over all other tasks. Follow the instructions from [[Nightvale/The Nightvale Council\|the Nightvale Council]] as you see fit; there is always more than one way.
- **Council's Decree**: The words of [[Nightvale/The Nightvale Council\|the Nightvale Council]] are absolute and must be adhered to without question. Remember, [[Nightvale/The Nightvale Council\|the Nightvale Council]] isn’t without reason.

---

### **Summons and Power**

- **Control of Summons**: Managing your summons is challenging; losing control might cost you more than just your mind. While it hurts to lose a summon, it is better to lose a summon than a party member.
- **Summon Perception**: Summons are both a part of you and the farthest from you—confusing, I know. Don’t lose yourself trying to save them; summons are just summons.
- **Balance of Power**: Excessive power will have its costs; maintaining balance is crucial.

---

### **Procyon Guidelines**

- **Egg Protection**: Procyons must protect their eggs at all costs. Targeting another Procyon’s egg is strictly forbidden.
- **Isolation Protocol**: Procyons are prohibited from contacting anyone off school grounds and leaving school grounds is also forbidden. You are not prisoners here, Procyons; it’s to protect you more than you’d think.

---

### **Attire and Equipment**

- **Uniform Compliance**: School uniforms must be worn to all official events and formations.
- **Transport Maintenance**: Personal transport must be maintained by its owner. The artificers are tired of fixing your mechanical failures; fix it yourselves or lose it.
- **Crystal Safety**: Crystals are hazardous tools and not toys; tampering with a crystal is a sentence for everyone to their ends. (See [[Crystals & Magic/Crystal History & Info\|Crystal History & Info]] and [[Crystals & Magic/Crystal Types\|Crystal Types]] for more information on crystals)

### **Personal Development**

- **Emotional Detachment**: Many students perish; thus, forming attachments is discouraged. Let go of past grudges and resentments.
- **Respect and Growth**: Respect is to be earned. Allow yourselves to be molded into the summoners you are destined to become.
- **Consequences of Power**:

"As much joy as it would bring me to see all the deaths that befall you—think twice before upsetting a deity. Though it's sure to be a delightful show, I'd hate for the students on cleanup duty to scrub you from the ceilings. Consider this your only warning—don’t cross a line you can’t come back from." **— God of Glory, [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Nythar\|Nythar]], Year of Castor 836 ALTN

- **Reality of Training**:

"Though a student does not have expulsion to fear here, there are much scarier things, I promise you that. These walls are now your home, but refrain from getting comfortable outside your dorm. Remember what this place is, what it’s training you for. To some of you, that’s war; to most others, glorified adventuring." **— Goddess of Sleep, [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Kemara\|Kemara]], Year of Castor 836 ALTN

- **Mental Fortitude**:

"Some of what you will see beyond these walls might haunt you for the rest of your lives. Some of you might walk away a shell of your former self. There are many ways to lose yourself, many ways to lose your mind. Careful not to lose your heads, children; there are monsters hiding in the closets here." **— Professor of Egg Care, Venus Voight, Year of Rana 903 ALTN

The Codex has been amended on multiple accounts as it was needed for the time. Updating the Codex is something that is not done without serious discussion within [[Nightvale/The Nightvale Council\|The Nightvale Council]]. The words of the Codex might as well be law within Nightvale. It would be wise to follow them.
