**The Archives of Nightvale**

A vault of forgotten truths and perilous knowledge, the Archives of [[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]] stands as a sanctum beyond mere scholarship—a cathedral to memory, guarded by ancient power. Though books in the realm are rare and often printed in limited runs, the Archives holds at least one copy of every volume ever printed more than once. In some cases, it shelters the final remnant of tomes otherwise lost to fire, war, or time. Yet even these relics pale in comparison to the true mystery housed within.

Winding between the towering shelves of the grand chamber walks **[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Aster\|Aster]]**, a deity long unmoored from the heavens. Known by students and scholars alike as the _Patron of Pages_ or _the God in the Stacks_, Aster is not revered in the traditional sense. He has lingered in the Archives for as long as any record recalls, scribbling endlessly, reading without rest. Mortals often treat him as an unusually helpful fixture—an animated catalogue more than a divine being. If this disregard offends him, he gives no sign. His eyes rarely leave the page.

The Archives, however, is not a place of comfort. Ancient wards—crafted long before the age of most kingdoms—line its stone walls. At its heart hangs a grand clock of tarnished brass, suspended above the central rotunda. When the hands approach midnight, students grow silent, hurried. For when the clock strikes twelve, **three bells sound**—clear, cold, and absolute. They do not ring to announce the hour; they toll to **warn**.

As the final chime echoes, the wards ignite. Pale blue runes etched deep into the stone shimmer to life, pulsing with buried magic. Once awakened, these spells lock the Archives in a state known as **Lockdown**—a total seal impervious to dispel, teleportation, or divine intervention. Only [[Important People & Noble Families/The Ilea Family\|The Ilea Family]] holds the knowledge of its origins or how the enchantment may be undone. All within are trapped until dawn.

And dawn does not come for all.

No one who has remained inside past the tolling of the bells has ever returned. None save for Aster, who refuses to speak of what stirs in the midnight dark. Whispers among students speak of silent footsteps, a cold breath on the neck, and books that bleed when opened. But such rumors are rarely repeated above a whisper. Fear has a way of rooting in stone.

To add to its eerie reputation, the Archives houses a place few dare even glance toward—the **Forbidden Section**. Set behind thick iron bars reinforced with layered runes, its entry gate glows faintly at all hours, trembling with quiet magical energy. Wards slumber beneath the metal floor, ready to awaken should any hand or spell attempt intrusion. Through the bars, one can glimpse a few shelves of decaying scrolls, bound in leather blackened with age, and beyond them, a dark stone stairwell descending into shadow. No light touches the depths below. What lies beneath remains unknown, and unspoken.

Despite its dangers, the Archives remains a common ground for all levels of students. Private study rooms may be requested from a scribe for those seeking quiet focus. Food and drink are strictly forbidden within its halls, though beverages may be entrusted to the attending scribe at the central desk. Combat of any kind is prohibited—disputes are to be taken outside. The Archives tolerates no chaos within its walls.

It remembers everything.

And it does not forgive trespass.

**The Whisper of Mara Vex**

Among the many whispered fears of the Archives, none lingers quite like the tale of _Mara Vex_. A name spoken with both reverence and dread, Mara was once a prodigy of [[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]]—sharp of mind, quiet of voice, and burdened with a curiosity that bordered on obsession. She was a disciple of forgotten gods and a scribe trusted with transcribing some of the oldest texts in the Archive’s eastern wing.

But Mara was not content with what the Archives offered to the obedient.

For months, she studied the runes etched into the gate of the **Forbidden Section**, sometimes under the guise of cleaning duty, other times pretending to be lost in study. She would linger by the iron bars longer than most, sketching the shapes of sigils into her notebooks, watching the pulsing rhythm of the protective wards with the gaze of someone trying to **understand** them—not fear them.

Then, one night, she was simply gone.

Her dormitory bed remained untouched. Her robes were found folded neatly on her desk, alongside an open book on magical ward manipulation and a single scrap of parchment. On it was drawn a rune—one that none recognized, not even Aster.

They say the wards were never triggered that night. No bells, no alarms, no screams.

But the next morning, the bars of the Forbidden Section were warm to the touch. A faint smell of burnt parchment clung to the air. Aster stood in front of the gate for hours, unmoving, eyes closed. When asked where Mara had gone, he simply said:

**“Curiosity is a staircase with no end.”**

Since that day, new rumors have grown. Some say they hear quiet weeping from the stairwell beyond the bars. Others claim that scrolls in the Forbidden Section have begun rearranging themselves—spelling out warnings in ancient tongues. One scribe claimed to glimpse a shadow at the bottom of the stairs, one with glowing blue eyes and a hand like Mara’s, clutched around a broken quill.

Officially, she is listed as _missing_.

But no one tries the gate now. Not even the bravest.
