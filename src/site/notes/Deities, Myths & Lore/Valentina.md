The goddess of Luck, a deity fairly popular to the mortals. She’s one of the deities who chose to stay around the [[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]]. However, she is one of the few that's known to stay away from the confining walls, choosing to have her own place within Vixgate ([[World History/Palonia/Countries/Fostrela (Fahs-trel-uh)\|Fostrela (Fahs-trel-uh)]]). Thought to be the sibling of [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Iana\|Iana]] and [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Aster\|Aster]], it’s only confirmed that she's related by blood to Iana. Her symbols are rabbits and four leaf clovers. She's known to have a soft spot for Harengons, *no one really knows why.
