The goddess of Dreams. One of the triplet deities, she has not been seen in over a century. Many mortals still worry for the young goddess, as she had always been loved and cared for by the mortals. Her disappearance was a shock, however mortals still dreamed meaning she couldnâ€™t be gone. Her symbol is a moonflower, the flower she was made from by her parents; [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Velo\|Velo]] and [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Aella\|Aella]].
