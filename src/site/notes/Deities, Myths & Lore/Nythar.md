The god of Glory. When his parents and siblings had fled from Cholk, he chose to go his own way. He had tried to urge [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Nutuna\|Nutuna]], his twin sister, to go with him, however she had made up her mind and chose to believe the mortals over her brother. Nythar now lives at the [[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]], commonly assisting during combat classes and challenges. Although no one has seen or heard from his brother [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Rytar\|Rytar]], Nythar himself has mentioned knowing of his whereabouts. Though he refuses to share anymore regarding his family. His symbols are gold and trophies, his wing of the Academy is known to be decked out in shining trophy cases.
