The god of the Skies. Married to [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Amros\|Amros]], the two are looked up to by mortals for their love life. Mortals often pray to them in the hopes they can find the same sort of love, despite love not being either of their trades. The two brought with them [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Velo\|Velo]], Amros having chosen to carry him to term instead of magically birthing him, how most other deities choose. [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Vearis\|Vearis]] is believed to be related to [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Calous\|Calous]] and [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Kemara\|Kemara]], though neither are confirmed. His symbols are clouds and sunrays.
