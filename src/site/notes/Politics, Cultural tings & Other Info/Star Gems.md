Star Gems, far rarer than their mundane counterparts. These wonderous gems were found long ago, deep within caves of different countries, shimmering gemstones were found where there had originally been nothing but stone. These gemstones were dubbed Star Gems due to the shimmering glow they emitted, many associated the shimmer to that of starlight. Originally these gems were used for nothing more than jewelry for the high society, however as their popularity grew, some had discovered that when they wore a certain type of Star Gem that they were gifted with helpful benefits. When this was investigated further it was found that those who shared the same type of star gem also shared the same birth month, so many began associating the stones with their birth months.

The accordance of the months went as follows:

| Month     | Star Gem        | Description                                  |
| --------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Hammer    | Star Garnet     | Deep red with a shifting inner light.        |
| Alturiak  | Star Amethyst   | Violet crystal laced with starlike flecks.   |
| Ches      | Star Bloodstone | Dark green streaked with crimson shimmer.    |
| Tarsakh   | Star Diamond    | Clear as glass, radiant with prismatic fire. |
| Mirtul    | Star Emerald    | Verdant green, pulsing with gentle warmth.   |
| Kythorn   | Star Pearl      | Softly luminescent, pale as dawn.            |
| Flamerule | Star Ruby       | Brilliant crimson with a golden heart.       |
| Eleasis   | Star Sardonyx   | Layered amber and white with inner glow.     |
| Eleint    | Star Sapphire   | Deep blue, flecked with astral silver.       |
| Marpenoth | Star Opal       | Multicolored gleam, ever-shifting hues.      |
| Uktar     | Star Topaz      | Golden-orange, gleaming like sunset.         |
| Nightal   | Star Turquoise  | Azure green with radiant swirls of light.    |

Star Gems resonate most strongly with those born under their corresponding month. When used as a **spell focus** or **enchantment core**, they amplify the wielder’s innate magic. Advanced enchanters also use them to **store spells** or **infuse weapons and armor**, crafting heirlooms of rare power.
