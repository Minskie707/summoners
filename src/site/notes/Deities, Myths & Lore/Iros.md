**Lore**  
Iros, God of Nightmares, is the second-born of the divine triplets sired by [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Velo\|Velo]], God of the Sun, and [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Aella\|Aella]], Goddess of the Moon. Where his sister [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Adone\|Adone]] wove dreams of serenity, Iros ruled the darker tides of the sleeping mind—the place where fear takes shape and truth hides in shadow. He was born from a single nightshade flower, its petals steeped in moonlight and sunlight both, yet tainted by the restless darkness between them.

The mortal world has never embraced Iros with warmth. His domain, the Realm of Nightmares, is a realm of shifting horrors, illusions, and half-formed thoughts—an endless labyrinth where one’s fears stalk the edges of reason. Many believed his presence to be a curse, bringing unrest and visions of despair. Only when Adone herself defended him before the mortal faithful did the open hatred subside. She reminded the world that nightmares, too, serve a purpose: they teach courage, and reveal what must be faced.

Over a century has passed since Iros vanished alongside his sister. Some claim the god was devoured by his own realm, lost within the storm of his creations. Others whisper he sleeps still, dreaming nightmares too vast even for mortals to survive. His elder brother [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Sotar\|Sotar]] remains the only one who still seeks him, following traces of his essence through the shadows of [[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]].

**Worship & Teachings**  
Those who revere Iros are few but steadfast. They are dreamwalkers, exorcists, and ascetics who believe that to conquer fear, one must first walk through it. His faith does not seek comfort—it seeks understanding. His priests wear robes of black and violet, and burn nightshade incense during their rites to open the mind to hidden truths.

Shrines to Iros are often secret or half-ruined, found at the edges of sleeping villages or beneath the foundations of temples to his sister. Offerings are made not for peace, but for endurance: to survive the long night and awaken stronger. His followers teach that nightmares are not punishment—they are the gods’ way of showing mortals the strength they have yet to find.
