# **Hunter Specialty**

_Summoning Discipline of [[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]]_

Hunters are swift, attuned, and fiercely devoted. Among Nightvale’s summoners, none are known for deeper or more intricate bonds than these agile protectors. Hunters treat their summons not as tools or trophies, but as partners—companions whose presence sharpens their senses and quickens their reflexes.

---
## **The Path of Motion and Instinct**

Hunter trainees cultivate speed and precision above all else. Their movements are fluid and silent; their agility so refined that legends tell of Hunters who step out of sight faster than the eye can track. This preternatural quickness often manifests the moment they forge their first bond, as if the presence of a companion awakens something primal within them.

Where other specialties chase knowledge or power, Hunters chase _connection_. Their bodies respond as their summons do—tensing, sprinting, reacting in uncanny synchronization.

---
## **A Bond Like No Other**

A Hunter’s true strength lies in their ability to weave powerful, personal bonds with every summon they command. No two connections are identical. Some bonds are warm and protective, others disciplined and tactical, others wild and instinct-driven. These relationships shape the abilities a Hunter’s summons unlock as their connection deepens.

At Nightvale Academy, the bonds Hunters form are studied with fascination. Their emotional resonance with their summons allows them to access forms of cooperative power that more traditional binding methods cannot replicate. A deeply attuned partnership can awaken new traits, strengthen latent abilities, or even alter a summon’s combat style.

---
## **Philosophy of the Oath**

Every Hunter swears the words that bind their calling:

### **“My companion is my friend.”**

This oath speaks not of ownership or power, but of loyalty. Hunters protect their summons as fiercely as they protect their peers. Their companions, in turn, respond to that devotion with unique primal magic—power that cannot be taught, only earned.

---
## **Public Perception**

Hunters are adored throughout the academy and beyond. Something about their presence—perhaps their quiet confidence or their unwavering loyalty—tends to draw others toward them. They are approachable where [[Nightvale/Summoning/Specialties/Collector\|Collector]]s are demanding, steady where [[Nightvale/Summoning/Specialties/Warg\|Warg]]s are fiery, and thoughtful where [[Nightvale/Summoning/Specialties/Phalanx\|Phalanx]] are stoic.

Their summons often reflect this charisma, forming pairs that move like mirrored spirits through forest, battlefield, or academy hall.
