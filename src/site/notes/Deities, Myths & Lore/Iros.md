The god of Nightmares. The second of the triplet deities, much like his sister he has been missing for over a century. However, unlike his sister, the mortals seem unbothered by this. The mortals had originally shown their dislike for him, only stopping once [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Adone\|Adone]] spoke against it. His symbol is the nightshade flower, as this was the flower he was made from by his parents; [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Velo\|Velo]] and [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Aella\|Aella]].
