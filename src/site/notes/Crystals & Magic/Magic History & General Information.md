While many might choose to believe that Palonia always had magic, this isn't necessarily true; long ago, before [[World History/The Night of Tau\|The Night of Tau]] Palonia was a rather mundane place. Although it was full of life, it lacked the arcane power that it has now. A while after the Night of Tau, the Deities that had arrived chose to gift the mortals of the world a fraction of their own power, allowing magic to run through the veins of Palonia freely.

Palonia has various forms of magic, the type most mortals are used to is that of the basic schools of magic; Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, and Transmutation. While some mortals might know things such as wild magic, a majority know the basic schools of magic. For the more adept in their trade, there are a few other types of magic, not taught in mundane magic schools. Nightvale Academy offers students the opportunity to learn from a few different forms of magic.

Students are taught various forms of casting spells as certain spells have certain ritual requirements that require teaching.

### Magic Seals & Circles:

There are two different ways to utilize magic circles to make your spells stronger, the first is more popular, the use of Magic Seals have been found to be used in place of the traditional work of a circle. Magic Seals are often times similar in appearance to traditional magical circles, the main difference being in the size. Magic Seals are designed to be used on small pieces of parchment, often times prepped in advance, the seal should only need a drop of blood to activate.

Magic Circles however are much bigger, often times needing to be drawn over the entirety of a rooms floor, they require precision and speed to be effective. While many might prep circles ahead of time, for certain spells it is almost impossible to prep a circle of the needed size ahead of time. Magic Circles should be drawn with enchantment chalk found in any magic shop, the runes must be precise and there can be no deviations.

### Magic Charms:

Magic Charms, also commonly called talismans, are powerful trinkets that can grant both passive effects and abilities one must activate. While enchanted Charms are the most common, there have been a few recorded Divine Charms. While both are useful, Enchanted charms are rather common and tend to have lackluster effects and abilities when compared to Divine Charms. The difference of the two might go unnoticed to the untrained eye, but to those who know the true power of Magic Charms the difference between a simple enchantment and a divine channel is quite vast.
