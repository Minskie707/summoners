**Lore**  
Sotar, God of Shadows and the Void, is the eldest of the triplets born to [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Velo\|Velo]], God of the Sun, and [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Aella\|Aella]], Goddess of the Moon. From his creation in the petals of a dark lotus—its roots nourished by sunlight and its bloom kissed by moonlight—Sotar inherited the quiet balance between radiance and absence. His dominion, the Void, is a vast expanse of formless shadow, where sound and color fade into nothingness. It is said to be not a place of evil, but of stillness—where all light returns when its purpose is complete.

Unlike his siblings, [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Adone\|Adone]] and [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Iros\|Iros]], Sotar has not vanished. Instead, he dwells among mortals, concealed within the ancient halls of [[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]]. Many whisper that he walks the grounds disguised as a scholar or shadow, searching ceaselessly for his lost kin. Though the mortals of [[World History/Palonia\|Palonia]] often regard him with unease, mistaking his silence for malice, Sotar has remained. His patience, like the void he governs, is endless.

He is the unseen observer, the watchful shadow cast by the light of his father and mother. His presence reminds mortals that darkness is not always destruction—it is the canvas upon which light is born.

**Worship & Teachings**  
Sotar’s faith is shrouded in secrecy. His followers—often spies, historians, or philosophers—seek knowledge hidden beneath the surface of things. They believe that truth is found not in brilliance, but in reflection and absence. Temples to Sotar are rare, existing in forgotten crypts or moonlit chambers, illuminated only by drifting incense and shadowed candles.

His worshippers revere the lotus as a sacred emblem: a bloom that rises from the murk to reach the light. Through meditation and quiet observation, they honor his teachings of patience, perception, and resilience.

At Nightvale Academy, it is said that Sotar’s shadow still lingers at dusk, watching from the edge of torchlight—ever seeking his brother Iros and his sister Adone, the lost fragments of his divine family.
