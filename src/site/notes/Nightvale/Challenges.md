The challenges that start during a summoners [[Nightvale/Levels#Vega\|Levels#Vega]], can be exceptionally difficult. Students can all earn tickets that allow them to choose an opponent rather than fighting the one the Nightvale Council had selected. Opponents can range from creatures and beasts to your fellow students. In some cases, special challenges are administered, these sometimes have less to do about your opponent and more about your surroundings. The mats in the gym are to be used for combat exercises, sparring, preferably without blood. The pit is where you can satiate your bloodlust. Challenges will be called before they’re to be fought, sometimes there's prizes worth the pain. No one is allowed to step in during a combat challenge until a summoner has tapped out. Sometimes tapping out might be the difference between life and death, don’t die for your pride.
