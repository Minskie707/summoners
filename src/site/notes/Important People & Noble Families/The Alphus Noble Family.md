The Alphus *Noble* Family, a family where their rise to power was forged not through blood or connections but through willpower and necessity. Long ago on The Night of Tau, the Dry Basin was left forgotten, once used as an desert prison for Keatara, the Dry Basin is now a lawless land of sorts. During The Night of Tau the Alphus family were the first to build a foundation for the abandoned prisoners to build a new life on. In doing this they were looked to for guidance, earning them their nobility. In those early years the Alphus family worked to build a place where families could be raised in peace, without fear of wars or suffering. However over the years their intentions changed to personal gain over altruism, they implemented taxes, took away protective laws, and rumors stir of under the table dealings.

Despite the rumors and recent governing choices, many of the people in the Dry Basin express praise towards the Alphus family, weather out of fear or admiration the name Alphus is a powerful one.

The Alphus Noble Family resides in the "capital" of the Dry Basin, Swiftstone. Their estate sits at the top of the sand swept cliff edge of Swiftstone,  built over the remnants of the Volcano that has grown dormant within the past hundred years. Their estate is often the center of many grand and lavish events and parties, never a quiet moment within the Alphus estate.

### Grand Duke Askari Alphus:

Grand Duke Askari Alphus, the elder of the Alphus family. The people rumor that he is as old as Caipra, as knowledgeable as Aster and as quiet as the desert winds. His presence is demanding of attention, dripping with pride and a tone of arrogance Askari holds himself on a pedestal and basks in people showing him their devotion. He greeted Mirella with a bright smile and open arms when Dirie brought his new wife home for the first time. Askari had even arranged for one of the most lavish events Swiftstone had seen.

### Duke Dirie Alphus:

Duke Dirie Alphus is a man with questionable motives, while his father Askari has the hold on the Dry Basin, Dirie has been known to be the one in control for a long time now. With or without Askari's knowledge the decisions made for the Dry Basin has been up to Dirie for the past fifty years. Dirie is no different from his father, holding himself in high stature with a high sense of pride, ruthless to all who wrong him no matter the status.

While the people were rather upset over the disappearance of the youngest Prince and the Duchess, Dirie grew angry at the mention of their names, banning the use of his sons name within the Dry Basin. When asked about his wife the Duke would grow quiet, a look of disgust and disappointment on his face before he would change the subject. He ordered the history of his son be burned, and with it his memory, however he refused to do so for his wife, gritting his teeth through the ritual the people present knew he wanted more. 

### Duchess Mirella Alphus:

Duchess Mirella Alphus, the crown jewel of Swiftstone. Mirella was the Dry Basin's flaming pride, a glowing goddess to the people. She was loved by many, her kindness rather abstract from her nature of strength and pride. While firm in her judgements, she allowed leeway where she could. When she married Dirie, she accepted Alanis as her own, and with Dirie she had two children of her own, REDACTED and Narin.

Mirella loved all her children equally, something Dirie could not do. When Mirella disappeared the people of the Dry Basin lost a bit of pride in their brilliant home. Some rumors sparked of Dirie leaving with her in the dead of night, but those were quickly shut down.

### Prince Alanis Alphus:

### Princess Narin Alphus:
