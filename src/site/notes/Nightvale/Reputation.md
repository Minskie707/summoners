Reputation; a small, yet explosive thing. Outside of [[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]] reputation is simply built off of your deeds, your name, your title. However within the walls of the Academy it will be rebuilt off of your assignments, your power, your summons, and much more. To many leaving Nightvale without a reputation is to fail without failing. 

  

“Some may say reputation does not matter, but clearly they have never stepped foot in an academy of all allegiances. Reputations are deadly little things, set to explode at the right poke. Best to forget your allegiances, leave them at the bridges with your loved ones.” — Professor of World History, Evie Kames, Year of Petra 918 ALTN

An important note on reputation, not all of it is good some might say its even terrifying. Although a strong reputation is desired, don’t forget what it’ll cost you to attain it. Lastly, a reputation built upon lies is similar to building a house out of paper mache.
