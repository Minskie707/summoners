**NOTORIETY:**
Your Notoriety level represents how well known your character is, amongst both peers and strangers. For most characters, your Notoriety level begins at 0, though your character’s background and/or history may increase it to 1 or 2 at first (at your DM’s discretion). Your Notoriety level will increase over the course of the campaign through social interactions and participation in major events, such as fights, sports, or performances.

When you make a Deception, Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion check, the DM may tell you to add your Notoriety level to the check. Your Notoriety will act as either a bonus or a penalty (the DM will tell you which) depending on who the check is made against. For example, if you are a known thief, your Notoriety level may act as a penalty when interacting with a merchant, but act as a bonus when interacting with a group of delinquents. If you are a noble instead, it may have the opposite effect.

Certain NPCs and factions have their own Notoriety levels as well. When you make a Deception, Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion check, and invoke the name of an NPC or faction that the target of your check has heard of, you can also add their Notoriety to your check, with the same rules. Be careful in doing so, however; if the NPC or faction in question did not give you permission to use their name, they may be bothered by you doing so, and you may damage your relationship with them.
