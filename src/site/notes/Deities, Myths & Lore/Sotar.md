The god of Shadows and Void. The last of the triplet deities, unlike his siblings he isn't missing, he is located within the [[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]]. It’s said he is searching for his siblings, convinced they’re somewhere within the Academy grounds. Despite the disdain and dislike from the mortals, he has stayed time and time again. His symbols are smoke and lotus flowers, given he was made from a lotus flower by his parents; [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Velo\|Velo]] and [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Aella\|Aella]].
