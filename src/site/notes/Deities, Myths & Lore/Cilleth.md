**Lore**  
Cilleth, the God of the Forge, is the master craftsman of the divine pantheon—a being of molten patience and earthen strength. His origin is shrouded in mystery, for no record claims his birth or parentage. Some say he was shaped from the heart of the world itself, born of pressure and flame rather than blood and lineage.

When the **[[World History/The Night of Tau\|The Night of Tau]]** came, Cilleth followed the same celestial call that drew many gods down from the heavens. Yet, unlike others who found land, he fell straight into the sea—his impact hissing through the waters, encased in a stone meteor that sank to the ocean floor.

It was **[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Amros\|Amros]], Goddess of the Sea**, who found him there. With gentle command over the waves, she lifted his stone prison and carried him across the waters to a quiet island near **Tront**. Though grateful, Cilleth was unsettled by the confinement and motion of the sea. He broke free of his rocky shell, his molten form steaming the tide as he stepped ashore. Seeking stillness, he journeyed inland and found solace in the caves of the **mountain ranges between Srico and Nolwood**. There, the forge god found his home—and from that day forth, the rhythmic sound of his hammer echoed through the stone valleys.

His forge, said to be eternal, is built into the spine of the mountains themselves. It is a place of unbearable heat and divine craftsmanship, where the air itself hums with creation. Few mortals have dared to enter, and fewer still have left unchanged. The walls of his workshop shimmer with veins of ore and crystal, the byproducts of his labor said to be gifts from the mountain’s soul.

**The Tridents of Amros**  
Years passed before the sea returned to him. Amros came again—this time not with salvation, but with a request. She sought a weapon that could command both the depths and the storms above. Cilleth refused her emissaries, his pride too strong to craft for one he had never seen. Only when **Amros herself appeared**, her form made of rolling sea foam and starlight, did he agree to forge her gift.

From his furnace, he drew metal infused with the essence of crystal—a material that could channel the living energy of the sea. When he struck his hammer upon the final piece, three tridents were born, radiant with the power of tide and storm. These would become **Amros’s sacred symbols**, and the first of Cilleth’s divine creations to leave his forge.

From then on, a quiet respect grew between the god of the forge and the goddess of the sea—a bond born not of love, but of mutual reverence. It is said that when thunder rolls over the ocean, it is the sound of Cilleth’s hammer striking in gratitude.

**Worship & Teachings**  
Cilleth’s followers, known as **The Tempered**, revere craftsmanship as the highest form of devotion. To them, creation is prayer and imperfection is sacred—proof that even gods must refine themselves through effort. His temples are workshops of iron and stone, where hammers never rest and apprentices whisper his name before every strike.

Cilleth teaches discipline, endurance, and mastery through repetition. Fire, he claims, is both destroyer and teacher—one must endure its trials to find true strength. His clerics bless tools, armor, and forges, invoking his name with the ringing of metal upon metal.

Where others see tools and weapons, Cilleth sees **purpose**—in every spark, every strike, every breath drawn beside the flame. For in his forge, even gods must bow to the rhythm of creation.
