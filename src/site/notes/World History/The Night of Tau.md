### 🜁 **The Night of Tau** 🜁  
In the age before reckoning, when the world was yet untouched by divine will, a night unlike any other cleaved history in twain. The sky split open with fire as meteors fell—fiery lances from the heavens—scarring the earth and shaking the bones of the world.

Where each star struck, there bloomed not only flame and smoke, but strange fragrances that stirred the soul: brine and blossoms, leather-bound tomes, scorched metal and loamy soil. The very air shimmered with color, and for a moment, the firmament wept tears of starlight.

When dawn kissed the battered land, **eighteen figures** stood where silence had fallen—each rising from a crater, radiant with otherworldly magic, steeped in scent and hue. Shifting and formless, they wore the faces of many, like changelings draped in the essence of eternity.

The mortals, never having known gods, beheld these beings with awe, terror, and trembling reverence. Though peace lay in their intentions, devastation marked their coming: cities were turned to rubble, islands sank, and thousands perished in fire and quake.

But sorrow softened their power. With hands of light and song, the celestial beings labored to mend what they had broken. And when the land was soothed, they bestowed a gift that would forever change the fate of mortal kind: **magic**.

And so they were named—**Gods, Deities, the All-Powerful**—and temples rose to honor them. Yet not all gifts are embraced, and not all powers are pure. Some gods were feared, reviled for the nature of what they had given. Mortals turned on their saviors, casting them out into exile.

Unable to return to the skies from whence they fell, the forsaken wandered the world, veiled in sorrow and forgotten by time. Of those once worshipped, only a few endure in memory—and perhaps, in shadow. It is said they yet linger, hidden among us, their true forms masked by clever guise.

### 🜃 **Supplemental Account — The Birth of Nightvale Academy** 🜃
– Scribe Beistina, Night of Tau, 918 ALTN:
Though the era before the Night of Tau lies shrouded in fading scroll and whispered myth, one truth remains certain: **before that night, mortals knew no gods**. The coming of the celestial beings did more than alter the hearts of mortal kind—it **transformed the world** itself. Magic surged through the leylines. Crystals rose from the ground like teeth of power. The very ecosystems of Palonia reshaped to accommodate forces previously unknown.

For many, this new age brought wonder. For others, it brought ruin.

Ancient records—many singed by time or censorship—place **blame upon one called Calous**, though his role in the divine descent remains disputed. Yet amidst the fire that rained from the heavens, something else came to be: a structure of breathtaking grandeur, so finely wrought it could only have been carved by the hand of a god.

As the people of **Vixgate** watched the sky split and stars fall, the earth too stirred. Upon a once-barren cliffside, a **fortress appeared**, silent and sudden. It bore no marks of construction. Its stone shimmered with iridescent veins, unknown to any mortal quarry or craftsman. The cliff that had stood empty at twilight now cradled a citadel humming with arcane life.

**No hammer struck its walls. No hand placed its stones.**

By order of the royal guard, and in awe of its mythical nature, the structure was named **Nightvale Academy**, after an old children’s tale whose origins are as mysterious as the fortress itself. Since that fateful night, Nightvale has become a beacon of magical scholarship—a place of learning, legend, and secrets as old as the gods themselves.

To this day, its halls echo with forgotten truths. Its spires shimmer in moonlight like the shards of fallen stars. And its presence remains the greatest enigma of the Night of Tau—**the night the sky wept fire, and gods walked among us.**
