### A Fable Told to Children, and Whispered by Scholars

Among the many stories told to children of [[World History/Palonia\|Palonia]], few linger in memory like the tale of _The Nightvale Curse._ To the common ear, it is a simple fable about grief and arrogance — a bedtime warning about asking too much of the heavens. Yet among scholars of [[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]], the tale carries darker weight. Beneath its moral lies a buried truth that some believe connects to the origin of the Academy itself.

### The Tale of the Weeping Queen

Long ago, before the modern kingdoms rose, there stood a grand castle of white stone and sapphire roofs. It watched over a fertile valley between twin mountains, its beauty said to outshine the stars. Within its halls lived a radiant princess, her hair the hue of a phoenix’s flame, her eyes a molten gold that caught the light of every dawn.

From her youth, she was loved by many, but her heart belonged only to one — a man of quiet strength and dark bearing, whose eyes glinted like tempered steel. The people spoke of them as light and shadow, day and night, bound together in perfect balance.

In time, they wed, and the kingdom prospered. Three children were born to them — two sons and a daughter — and all seemed destined for an age of peace. But fate, as always, demanded its due.

From the northern lands came war. The princess’s parents, the reigning monarchs, rode to battle beside her beloved consort. For two long years, the war dragged on — until word returned of a crushing defeat. The king and queen had fallen, and the consort was lost, presumed dead.

The princess’s grief was said to shake the heavens. Her cry shattered the glass of her own throne room, and her tears fell upon the white stone like rain upon marble. Among those who served her was a devoted mage — her advisor and confidant, who could not bear to see her sorrow.

### The Bargain Beneath the Stars

When comfort failed, the mage sought vengeance. One moonless night, he journeyed to the forest’s edge and lifted his voice to the stars, demanding justice. None had ever claimed the heavens answered such pleas — until that night.

> _“Well, well… someone sounds desperate,”_ came a voice, feminine and soft as silk. _“Tell me, what is it you desire for your tale?”_

Startled but resolute, the mage declared, _“Retribution upon the kingdom to the north. They have brought ruin to my sovereign. Let them suffer a fate worse than death.”_

> _“How delightful,”_ the voice replied, its tone like laughter from a distant stage. _“As you wish.”_

The earth trembled. From his vantage point on the cliffside, the mage watched as the distant northern castle began to sink into the ground, swallowed whole by dust and darkness. The war, it seemed, was over.

### The Queen’s Judgment

Triumphant, the mage returned to the castle at dawn, eager to share the news. Yet he found panic within the walls — the people wailing, the air heavy with dread. Unmoved, he went to his sovereign and recounted what he had done.

Her gaze, once warm, was cold as iron. Though his act had ended the war, it had been born of selfish wrath, not love. He had called upon the stars not as a servant of justice, but as an agent of spite.

The Queen rose from her seat, her voice trembling but firm. She ordered his imprisonment at once, declaring that her crown must serve her people, not her heart. Her guards seized him, ignoring his pleas.

> _“I did this for you!”_ he cried.  
> _“You did this for yourself,”_ she answered.

He was confined to the palace dungeons, and later sent across the western sea to a prison isle — Syrenth, a place of no return.

### The Plea Unanswered

Alone in his cell, the mage called again to the stars, begging the unseen woman to return, to justify his actions, to make the Queen understand. But the heavens were silent.

He prayed each night until his final breath, filling the walls of his hovel with drawings of the woman who had answered him — a figure of shifting starlight, silver-blue hair cascading over her shoulders, eyes bound by a black velvet lace. In every sketch, her shape was slightly different, as if she could not be captured in one form.

When the villagers found his remains, they discovered among the scattered parchment a single painting of her likeness — serene, otherworldly, adorned with a faint crown of antlers. They hung the portrait in their communal hall, calling it _The Lady of the Stars,_ and to this day, those who gaze upon it swear the stars behind her shimmer faintly in the dark.

### Moral and Hidden Meaning

The fable’s moral is simple: _Never pray to the stars in anger._ Yet the story’s details echo too closely with ancient records to dismiss. Scholars note that the valley described matches the geography surrounding the ruins of the ancient Aurelian Castle, and the “castle that sank” mirrors the recount from [[World History/The Night of Tau\|The Night of Tau]] of Nightvale Academy rising from the ground.

Those who study forbidden magic whisper that the mage’s unseen benefactor was no celestial spirit, but a being far older — one who answers the desperate with promises wrapped in beauty. Some call her the _Starbound Lady_, others the _Veiled Seraph_, though her true name has been lost.

If the tale is to be believed, the Nightvale Curse is no fable at all, but a record of the day a mortal voice reached the ear of something that should never have answered.
