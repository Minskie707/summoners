Although orphans might be located everywhere, there aren't orphanages in every town. However every capital houses at least one orphanage. The kingdoms and people of the capital housing the orphanage are to provide one of the basics to assist in caring for the orphans, this can include, food, clothes, blankets, or in some rare cases toys are accepted instead. Despite the call for assistance in taking care of the orphans, many orphanages are left with barely enough to care for those it houses.
