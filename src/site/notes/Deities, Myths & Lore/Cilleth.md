The god of the Forge. Much like [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Uril\|Uril]], Cilleth followed the stars that night. Finding himself landing in the middle of the ocean. [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Amros\|Amros]], having control of the seas, helped Cilleth; using her waves to move him to an island near Tront. Uncomfortable from being encased in a rock and dragged through the ocean, he moved to a cave in the mountains outside Tront. Resting for a while he eventually moved to the ranges between Srico and Nolwood. Setting himself up indefinitely, building his legendary forge few dare enter. Eventually, the ocean came knocking on his door, asking for a kind of weapon. Cilleth only agreed once Amros, the women of sea foam who had saved him, showed herself to him. He made her the tridents that are now her symbol, and designed them with the foresight of crystals. His symbols are hammers and anvils.
