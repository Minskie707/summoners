The Nightvale Curse is more of a fable, a children's tale, than a curse. It’s said that long, long ago there was a grand castle, and within this castle was a beautiful princess. The princess had hair resembling a phoenix’s flames, and her eyes were an entrancing hazel of golds, browns, and greens. Although she was loved by her people, she was often very sad. The princess had lost her love in a horrible accident with the neighboring kingdom. While she would spend hours wallowing in sorrow, her family's royal advisor and archmage’s wrath grew. How dare someone do such a thing to his princess, he swore a silent oath unbeknownst to the princess to get revenge in her name. The archmage worked tirelessly, day and night on a suitable revenge. His wrath only grew as he was unable to find the answers he wanted, in one last effort to get his way, he called upon the stars for guidance. He beckoned them to him at the highest peak while the kingdom held a celebration. He waited for minutes, then hours, desperately holding on, and just as he was about to give up… he heard a woman’s voice calling to him. The woman called herself **REDACTED** , she asked him why he seemed so angry. He told her why he was angry while begging her to appease this wrath inside him. When he answered she laughed not a mocking laugh but a soft one, before she spoke again.

“Well, if that’s all…” she said softly before the ground trembled very lightly beneath him. The sounds of chaos echoed off the mountains from the kingdom to the far north. Although he heard nothing more from **REDACTED**, he saw an image of a smiling woman within his mind for a moment before it faded like an old memory. A sickening grin spread across his face and he made his way back to his tower of the castle, not bothering to find out what happened before sleeping peacefully, his wrath feeling lighter.

In the morning the news had reached their kingdom, the neighboring kingdom’s palace and war college had vanished. Not only had the building seemingly disappeared, but the people within had gone with it. The archmage felt confident in his decision, going to take the news to the princess. However he was not met with the praise he’d expected, rage flamed on in the princess’s eyes. Unbeknownst to the archmage the princess was close with the other kingdom’s princess, she felt no blame towards the other kingdom. Her father, the king was enraged by the decision of his archmage. It was unacceptable of him to think he had the right to call upon the wrath of the stars. For the stars job is to remain as unbiased guides to the people. The king banished him from their lands, sending him to the island of Syrenth, an island used as a prison of sorts.


While the archmage’s punishment was set, somewhere dark and cold the neighboring kingdom found its new place. Upon waking the people within found not only a new home for themselves but dark tendril-like vines burrowed into their skin, turning their veins dark around the vines. Their eyes changing color, along with their hair and skin tones. Everything about them became devoid of color almost overnight, few holding onto a slight pigment. It was such a drastic difference, that many panicked and fled from the building seemingly disintegrating upon stepping outside the walls of the palace grounds. Slowly, they became accustomed, calling what had happened to them, The Nightvale Curse.


The fable speaks of how the man remained loyal to **REDACTED**, and how he continued to serve her. He had become almost obsessed with her, making attempt after attempt to hear from her again. When he had finally fallen to an illness that swept the island, the other occupants found his hovel in ruin. The floor was absolutely littered with parchment and drawings. What had appeared to once be beautiful drawings and paintings of a woman were burned, or torn at the face. There had to be hundreds of drawings and paintings done by the former archmage, all of what looked like the same woman. As if by a stroke of luck, the other islanders found *one* intact portrait.
