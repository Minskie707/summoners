The Dry Basin is a nearly uninhabitable, volcanic desert island. Having minimal plant life outside of the beaches. The land had originally been used by [[World History/Keatara\|Keatara]] as a sort of prison. Prisoners were commonly sent out to deserted lands to die of starvation and thirst if the wildlife and the volcano didn’t get them first. However, after [[World History/The Night of Tau\|The Night of Tau]], the people left in the Dry Basin were free to make the most of the land they had. The most commonly found species (besides humans) here are Dragonborn, tortles, half-orcs, pink and orange tieflings, aarakocra, thri-kreen, githyanki, goliath, and goblins.

  

## Swiftstone:

The capital of the Dry Basin. The largest, and only city in the Dry Basin. “Ruled” by [[Important People & Noble Families/The Alphus Noble Family\|The Alphus Noble Family]], who appointed themselves the rulers of the Dry Basin on the Night of Tau. No one cared and so they now rule the lands. The climate is a moderate temperature and dry.

  

## Bonefield:

The only other civilization in the Dry Basin. A smaller farming town, with cattle. The climate is hot and dry.
