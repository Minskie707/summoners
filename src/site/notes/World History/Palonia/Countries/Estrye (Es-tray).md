Estrye is a mountainous jungle. The capital sits on a peninsula, protected on all sides by water and high mountains. To many not native to Estrye, it’s known as a deadly oasis. The jungles are full of dangerous creatures. Most of Estrye’s cities and towns are accessible by road, however, a few are only accessible by boat. Midsummer is highly celebrated throughout the whole country, their maypoles are kept in peak condition and have never moved from their original posts. Estrye is ruled by [[Noble Families, Important People, & Guilds/The Citrela Royal Family\|The Citrela Royal Family]]

  

## Nagos:

The capital and the largest city of Estrye. Since it's on a peninsula it is protected by water and high mountains. This means there's also only one roadway in and out of Nagos, known as the Queen’s Road. Nagos holds the most popular Midsummer festival every year, the maypole stands 20 ft tall. The climate is hot and dewy.

The city is known to house a large market for magical and artificer goods as the country holds a steady trade route with Hythe in The Shattered Isles.
