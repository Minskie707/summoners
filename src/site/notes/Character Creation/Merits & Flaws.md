The boards listed below will give the player character possible benefits within the campaign, however these benefits come with a cost in added flaw. This is to help force there to be at least a semblance of balance within campaign. At the start of the campaign players will be given 25 points to slot into the Merit and Flaw boards below, at every level up PCs will be given 10 points to slot where they wish. Over the course of the campaign players will be given the chance to earn more points outside of leveling, at the DM's discretion.

Players will be given a number of points to distribute amongst their merits and flaws. An equal number of points must be slotted across both merits and flaws. (ex: 5 points to merits + 5 points to flaws = 10 points) Points are to be distributed in increments of 5

Merits will act as "buffs" to the PC depending on the description of the merit. Flaws in turn will act as "de-buffs" to the PC depending on the description of the flaw. At different points throughout the campaign players will be asked to select from a new Merit and Flaw board which will be added below.
