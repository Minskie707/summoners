# **Saor Specialty**

_Summoning Discipline of [[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]]_

Saors are wanderers of dream and earth—elusive summoners bound to the wild magic that threads through the natural world. Of all Nightvale’s disciplines, Saors are the most spiritually attuned, walking a path shaped not only by ancient tradition but by visions granted through the patron deity tied to their specialty. Their abilities flow like wind through trees, quiet yet powerful, rooted in instinct and communion rather than rigid study.

## **Dreamers of the Wild**

Traditionally, Saors practiced intricate rituals to call and shape their summoning magic. In recent decades, however, the discipline has shifted toward dream-guided communion. Through sacred visions—subtle whispers gifted by their deity—Saors forge deep, intuitive bonds with their summons. These visions act as lessons, warnings, or spiritual rites, replacing the structured spell work other specialties rely upon.

This dream-magic makes their power unpredictable but often profound.

## **Bonds Forged in Spirit and Soil**

Saors share an unusually strong connection with their summons, rivaled only by the fabled bonds of the [[Nightvale/Summoning/Specialties/Warg\|Warg]]s. These relationships are woven from empathy, natural magic, and shared instinct. Their summons are not commanded, but invited; not bound, but trusted. In return, Saor summons often display heightened willpower and autonomy.

This philosophy is reflected in the Saor oath, which many interpret as an affirmation of mutual freedom rather than ownership.

## **Selfless Hearts, Competitive Spirits**

Saors are widely known as the first to step forward when others are in danger. Their compassion runs deep, and many will sacrifice themselves long before allowing harm to fall upon another. This altruism stands in curious contrast to their fierce desire to surpass other specialties—an internal conflict well known among their ranks.

Some attribute this duality to the influence of their deity: one aspect nurturing, one ever pushing them to evolve.

---

## **Earthbound Power**

Saors are strongest when their summons walk beside them. Their abilities channel through their companions like currents through living conduits. When connected, a Saor can draw upon the vitality of soil, root, and stone, shaping natural magic with far more potency than when they stand alone.

A Saor without their summon is still capable—but a Saor with their summon is a storm given form.

---

## **Philosophy of the Oath**

All Saors speak the words that define their calling:

### **“My companion is free.”**

This oath reflects their belief that power grows best when unshackled. Their summons are not guardians or tools—they are equals walking beside them.

---

## **Public Perception**

Among the academy, Saors are admired for their kindness and trusted for their reliability in crises. Their serene presence and dream-touched insight often give them an aura of mystery. Yet their competitiveness ensures they are never mistaken for meek.

They remain the specialty most likely to help a stranger, yet also the one most determined to prove themselves when challenged.
