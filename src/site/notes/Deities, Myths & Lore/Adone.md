**Lore**  
Adone, the Goddess of Dreams, is the youngest of the divine triplets born of [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Aella\|Aella]], the Moonmother, and [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Velo\|Velo]], the Sunfather. Where her parents embody light and rhythm, Adone governs the realm that lies between—where consciousness drifts and imagination takes form.

Forged from a single moonflower kissed by both sunlight and moonlight, Adone was said to carry the warmth of her father and the serenity of her mother. Her laughter was once said to scatter nightmares, her presence lulling even the fiercest beasts to sleep. To mortals, she was a symbol of safety and hope—a promise that even in darkness, there is peace.

A century past, Adone vanished without warning. Her temples fell silent, her voice unheard among the gods. Yet mortals still dream. Scholars of the divine argue that she remains alive, perhaps lost within her own dominion—the Realm of Dreams—where reality and reverie intertwine. To this day, her priests insist that her unseen hand still weaves visions through mortal slumber.

**Worship & Teachings**  
Adone’s faithful are poets, healers, and dreamwalkers who seek meaning in the veil between worlds. They believe dreams are the whispers of the divine—messages from the goddess herself. Her teachings value introspection, compassion, and the quiet strength found in vulnerability.

Shrines to Adone are simple and serene, often built under open skies and decorated with moonflowers that bloom in her honor. Worshippers place these blossoms beneath their pillows to invite her blessings and ward away nightmares.

Though her absence endures, her followers await her return, believing she dreams still—wandering the borders of sleep and waking until she finds the path home, guided by the light of her parents’ eternal dance across the sky.
