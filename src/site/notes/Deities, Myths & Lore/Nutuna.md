The goddess of Youth. She is a twin to [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Nythar\|Nythar]], and sister to [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Rytar\|Rytar]] and [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Aella\|Aella]]. Her parents being [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Calous\|Calous]] and [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Atia\|Atia]], she was left behind in Cholk as they ran. At least that's how she sees it, however if her mother could have, she would have taken her with them. Nutuna was left alone by mortals, as they thought her domain was worthy of their worship. The mortals told her of how her parents and other siblings had fled, leaving her to die to the riot. Nutuna being young, believed them. Rumored among mortals, she has made her home in Panta ([[World History/Palonia/Countries/Abus (Ah-boos)\|Abus (Ah-boos)]]); at a temple carved into the mountain with strong dedication to her. Her symbols are babies and budding flowers.
