**Estrye — The Jungle Crown of Palonia**

Estrye is a land where **mountain and jungle entwine**, its valleys steaming with life and its cliffs rising like ancient guardians. The kingdom’s heart rests on a lush peninsula, the capital city of **Nagos**, protected by sheer mountains and encircling waters. To outsiders, Estrye is called _the Deadly Oasis_—a paradise wrapped in peril, where venomous beasts stalk beneath emerald leaves and the air itself hums with unseen magic.

Though its jungles are treacherous, Estrye thrives with music, color, and tradition. Roads cut through the canopy to bind the country together, though some towns can only be reached by winding rivers or by sea. Every summer, Estrye bursts into celebration for its great **Midsummer festival**, where ancient maypoles, untouched since their first raising, stand as sacred symbols of renewal and joy.

Estrye is ruled by **[[Noble Families, Important People, & Guilds/The Citrela Royal Family\|The Citrela Royal Family]]**, who have long balanced their people’s deep ties to nature, magic, and trade.

- _Notable Features:_ Queen’s Road, Crownbranch Hold, largest Midsummer festival.  
    The jewel of Estrye, Nagos lies at the end of the **Queen’s Road**, the only passage leading through the mountains to its peninsula.

The waters around the town glow with strange lights at night, and travelers tell of voices calling from the mist, luring them into bogs. Whether truth or superstition, few enter Moit without caution.
