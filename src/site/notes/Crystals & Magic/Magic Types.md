## Beyond the Eight Schools

> _“To shape the Weave is to learn control.  
> To step beyond it is to court the unknown.”_  
> — Headmistress Caipra Ilea, Nightvale Academy

While most mages study within the Eight Schools of traditional magic, some seek paths far older—and far less forgiving. These arts are rare, dangerous, and often misunderstood, for they reach beyond the ordered Weave of magic gifted by the gods.

Few survive long after touching such power, and fewer still master it. The following traditions represent the most infamous and potent **unorthodox magics of [[World History/Palonia\|Palonia]]**.

### Summoning Magic

_“To summon is to invite a soul across the veil. What you offer—and what answers—are never the same.”_

Summoning Magic is the foremost of Palonia’s specialized arcane disciplines, taught exclusively within the halls of **[[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]]**. Practitioners—called **Summoners**—bind creatures through intricate **seals** and **circles**, using their own lifeforce as a conduit.

Each summoning is a pact written in power rather than words. A Summoner’s strength lies not only in their spell work, but in the **bond** they forge with the entities they call forth. Many treat their summons as companions or extensions of their will—others as weapons.

Though the practice is ancient, its full potential remains shrouded. Those who attempt it without proper training often meet disastrous ends, their bodies and souls torn between planes.

> **Academy Warning:**  
> Students permitted to study summoning magic must sign a binding release form acknowledging the risk of bodily harm, spiritual fragmentation, or death.

### Crystal Magic

_“Every crystal sings, if you learn to listen. The song just might drive you mad.”_

**Crystal Magic** manipulates the latent resonance within magical crystals to alter or enhance spells, items, and machinery. Each crystal type carries unique arcane properties—some amplify energy, others stabilize enchantments, and a rare few can store entire spells. (see [[Crystals & Magic/Crystal Types\|Crystal Types]])

Practitioners, called **Crystalmancers**, combine **runes** and **glyphs** to channel a crystal’s essence into tools, armor, or weapons. This craft has led to the creation of legendary artifacts—but also countless catastrophes, as unstable crystal combinations can warp spells beyond recognition.

Though common crystals serve simple functions, **true Crystal Magic** requires balance: understanding which stones harmonize, which clash, and which are too dangerous to ever touch. Most successful Crystalmancers are equal parts mage and artisan, their workshops glittering with beauty and peril alike.

### Chaos Magic

_“It is not madness. It is motion—the endless unmaking of all things.”_

Little is known about **Chaos Magic**, save that it is the raw essence of entropy itself. Scholars believe it to originate from a **primordial being of pure chaos**, a force older than the gods and unbound by the laws of creation.

Those who wield Chaos Magic act as conduits for that living tempest. Their spells bend unpredictably, warping in form and effect much like a **wild magic surge**—but on a grander, more volatile scale.

Only a handful of mortals have survived direct exposure to this magic, and all report a singular experience: hearing whispers that speak in no language, urging them toward destruction and renewal in equal measure.

To channel Chaos Magic is to abandon control. It is not cast—it is _unleashed._

### Love Magic

_“Desire is the oldest spell ever woven.”_

Where Chaos destroys, **Love Magic** binds. It draws from the power of a **primordial being of Love and Lust incarnate**, an entity whose influence weaves through mortal hearts and divine passions alike.

Though often dismissed as superstition, Love Magic is very real—and very dangerous. Its effects blur the line between charm and compulsion, capable of igniting devotion, obsession, or even despair. Those touched by it describe sensations of warmth and yearning that can border on divine ecstasy or madness.

Practitioners are rare and secretive, for misuse of Love Magic can twist even the purest intentions. Some use it to heal hearts or inspire courage; others, to enslave the will.

Legends tell of mages who mastered this art living unnaturally long lives, their beauty untouched by time, their eyes glimmering with allure that defied mortal comprehension.

> **Warning from [[Nightvale/The Nightvale Council\|The Nightvale Council]]:**  
> “Love Magic is not to be mistaken for charm spells. It is not an imitation of affection—it _is_ affection, forced; manifested and uncontrollable.”

### The Cost of Forbidden Arts

To touch these magics is to invite consequence. Unlike the structured schools of arcana, these forces draw from the primal core of the world—and from the entities that shaped it. Their power grants great reward, but every spell leaves a mark.

The Summoner’s soul frays with each binding.  
The Crystalmancer risks madness from resonance.  
The Chaos Mage dances on the edge of oblivion.  
The Lover-Mage tempts corruption of heart and spirit.

And yet, for some, that cost is worth everything.
