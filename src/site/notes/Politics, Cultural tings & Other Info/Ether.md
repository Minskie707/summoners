To most, Ether is considered "corrupt liquid starlight," though there is some truth to this. In actuality, Ether is a dark, dangerous mimicry of the rare, ancient magical component known as *[[Politics, Cultural tings & Other Info/Liquid Starlight\|Liquid Starlight]]*. True Liquid Starlight is a silvery, glowing droplet that, according to legend, falls directly from the heavens—a gift from the stars themselves. Ether, however, is an entirely different substance, with a dark, viscous appearance streaked with eerie greenish-teal undertones. Unlike Liquid Starlight, which is mythically pure, Ether corrupts whatever it touches.

Liquid Starlight appears only in the oldest tales, where its rarity is akin to myth. Ether, on the other hand, emerged seemingly out of nowhere within the last few centuries. Its discovery has been shrouded in secrecy, and only small deposits have been reported deep within the caverns of [[World History/Palonia/Countries/Estrye (Es-tray)\|Estrye (Es-tray)]] and in the darkest reaches of [[World History/Palonia/Countries/Fostrela (Fahs-trel-uh)\|Fostrela (Fahs-trel-uh)]] and [[World History/Palonia/Countries/Abus (Ah-boos)\|Abus (Ah-boos)]]. Its true source remains withheld, perhaps for good reason.

**Properties and Effects:**
Ether is highly dangerous when consumed, causing a horrific transformation over three stages:

- Stage One: Victims lose all appetite, experience nausea, and rapidly lose weight. The whites of their eyes begin to darken, tinged gray.

- Stage Two: Fatigue intensifies, accompanied by growing pains as limbs elongate unnaturally. Skin pigmentation changes to either pitch black or ghostly white, and the whites of the eyes darken to a deep gray.

- Stage Three: The victim’s mind deteriorates, leading even the most strong-willed to madness. Claws grow, eyes turn black, and teeth sharpen into fangs, completing their transformation into a terrifying [[Politics, Cultural tings & Other Info/Etherlings\|Etherlings]]—a feral, twisted creature driven by an insatiable rage.

The time span for these transformations varies, occurring over 3 days to 2 weeks, with intense suffering at every stage.

While deadly when ingested, Ether has value in certain forms of magic. It is effective in constructing powerful magic circles and can be used as a component in specific spells, including *Revivify* and *Mending*. However, when Ether is used in spells, it often warps them, granting them darker effects. Ether cannot be used in spells from the following schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, and Enchantment (with rare exceptions). In healing or restorative spells, it typically fails, but certain necromantic rituals gain sinister power from its touch.

**Value and Trade:**
Ether is highly regulated due to its dangerous nature and the unpredictable effects it can have on spells. Most cities outlaw its possession or sale, but in the lawless regions of the Dry Basin, Ether is traded more freely. Even in restricted cities, those in the know can find it—at a price. Depending on potency and demand, Ether costs anywhere from 300 to 1,000 gp per vial.

**Availability:**
Ether remains scarce even in the magical black market. In its raw form, it is nearly impossible to find in reputable shops, but it circulates among those who dare to experiment with its power.
