Etherlings are made through the ingestion of Ether by a creature. While highly uncommon for the abnormality to find its way into beasts it has happened on rare occasion, being classed as the most dangerous of the abnormalities for their unpredictability. The stages are as follows:

- Stage One: Victims lose all appetite, experience nausea, and rapidly lose weight. The whites of their eyes begin to darken, tinged gray. A fever taking hold of their bodies and unpredictable spasms that leave victims in pain.

- Stage Two: Fatigue intensifies until many are left bedridden, accompanied by growing pains as their limbs elongate unnaturally. Their skin pigmentation changing to either pitch black or ghostly white, and the whites of the eyes darken further to a deep gray.

- Stage Three: The victim's mind deteriorates, leading even the most strong-willed to madness. Claws break their way free from the fingertips, eyes turn black, teeth sharpening into fangs. As the transformation completes a twisted and insatiable rage takes over the victims, along with a growing hunger for an unknown craving.

Etherlings are what becomes of those who ingest Ether in its raw form. For most the process is excruciating and in many cases deadly as more affected creatures tend to die during stage two; either because their bodies are too weak to complete the transformation or because of their own volition. Many choose to die rather than turn into a monster. Unfortunately not many are capable of healing the affliction, few clerics know the magic capable of healing it and even then it only works 70% of the time before a victim is too far into stage two. Some speak of a potion sold in the darker parts of markets, one capable of holding back the affliction of Ether, however nothing has been confirmed about its existence.
