There are countless types of magical crystals, however there are a good bit that we know of. The crystals listed below have been the most common within mortal households. Their mundane uses have also been listed.


## Basic Crystals:

### Fire Crystals:

The crystal feels warm in your hand, swirling with different shades of orange and yellow. Fire crystals have a warm glow that shines from within, giving off dim light within a 10ft radius. These crystals are to be used in crystal hearths or crystal fire pits, the runes engraved in the stones will activate the crystal and give you the same effect of a crackling fire. Fire Crystals have been used in replacement to coal and fire wood for centuries. Although they’re not a main source of light anymore, fire crystals are still used within small lanterns, and in many cases, as a replacement to candles.

### Spirit Crystals:

The crystal has a soft magical hum to it, shining the same shade as a yellow citrine with an almost eerie lavender shimmer to it. Spirit crystals are used as a form of communication. They can be used to contact any living being, as long as you know their name; however it wont go through if they do not have a spirit crystal on their being. The crystals can be used to contact multiple people as well, commonly being used for meetings with those across the world. Spirit crystals, similarly to memory crystals can hold information, however spirit crystals hold thoughts; small pieces of information, a lot like short notes on things.

### Memory Crystals:

The crystal at base is a mix of swirling blues. When a memory crystal is activated it will have swirling silver strands almost floating within the crystal. An activated memory crystal will give off dim pale blue light within a 5ft radius, the light itself originates from the silver strands within. Memory crystals are used to store and view memories. The process for storing and viewing memories is different, to store a memory requires a difficult ritual. To store a memory, a full memory takes practice and a strong-willed mind. Viewing memories is the easy part, you can simply hold the crystal to view it yourself or place it within a viewing basin to project the memory.

### Health Crystals:

The crystal is a deep red color with shimmers of silver in the light. Health crystals are one of the most common crystal. Health crystals provide better healing than standard potions, providing 2d8 +4 healing upon use. Crystals take a full action to use and heal friendly creatures within a 15ft radius of the crystal. 

### Ice Crystals:

The crystal feels cold to the touch and covers what it touches in a soft layer of frost. Ice crystals look like a pure blue ice from the purest of glaciers with a soft blue glow to them, however they do not melt as normal ice does. Ice crystals are used most commonly to preserve things, the layers of frost provided when placed in an ice chest are good at keeping various forms of food good for longer periods of time than normal ice.

### Light Crystals:

The crystal glows with a warm white light emanating from it, the color of a pure white quartz. Light crystals give of bright light within a radius of 30ft and dim light within an additional radius of 15ft. Light crystals will commonly be found within mineshafts as amounts of light crystals are provided to those working the mines, however outside of that light crystals may only be found in the richest of company. While Light crystals are considered a basic crystal, they are quite expensive for the common folk.

## Advanced Crystals:

There are a few other types that have more advanced uses. Crystals such as these are not commonly available to the general public due to the danger in handling them. Listed below are crystals the average member of the general public has most likely never handled let alone seen.


### Gravity Crystals:

These crystals look like a pure amethyst, deep purples with a soft purple glow to them. Gravity crystals when placed within the correct holding chamber are activated safely, the chambers that are used to hold gravity crystals act as an anchor for the item/items being affected. Gravity crystals are used on flying ships to send them into the air. Using a gravity crystal without a working chamber for it is illegal across all [[World History/Palonia\|Palonia]], by order of [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Uril\|Uril]] herself. 

### Life Crystals:

These crystals, similarly to health crystals, are a deep red color; however they are speckled with gold looking flakes rather than silver. While life crystals are uncommon to most people, adventurers and summoners are much too used to their presence. Life crystals can be used to bring someone back to life, they are one time use crystals and for that they are quite expensive. Many who find themselves facing danger have at least one of these crystals on them at all times. The crystal takes an action to use, and upon use the dead creature is brought back, gaining 3d8 +4 hit points back.

### Containment Crystals:

These crystals can look a deeply colored smokey quartz, with a hollow looking inside that allows light to pass through slightly giving the crystals an eerie shadowed glow. Containment crystals can vary in sizes, depending on what they are needed to contain. When activated correctly a creature can be contained within the crystal, once a creature is contained the hollowed inside shows the creature in a hibernation state, a soft colored fog surrounding them. Uril has stated the fog is the creatures very being, the essence that makes up their ideology, their aura, their soul. Containment crystals are only sanctioned to be used in dire circumstances as many have argued against the morality of its use on common criminals.

Before containment crystals were unsanctioned for uses on minor crimes, many containment crystals were made with some minor changes to them. Called Minor Containment Crystals, these crystals only hold the creatures soul rather than their body. Minor containment crystals were commonly used to tie criminals to a certain duty or job, as a form of punishment for their crimes; this was most common in discretions against a kingdom where a criminal with more minor crimes might be tied to a duty of servant or in some cases guard depending on physical stature.
  
### Surveillance Crystals:

These crystals can look like various types of obsidian, commonly dark and rounded in shape. Surveillance crystals are placed within metal sockets etched in runes that allow the crystals to work. Commonly surveillance crystals send the images and sound they capture to a "mother crystal", which is ordinarily locked away in its own room or area, with an attendant left to watch it. Surveillance crystals can be found around public facilities as well as within many noble family homes.
