The god of Education and Knowledge. Along with his so called siblings, he stays close to the [[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]]. Aster chooses to stay within the schoolâ€™s archives, keeping the books and histories updated to their fullest extent. Though many believe he is simply there as a glorified scribe, he works more as the guardian of the archives; protecting the forbidden section of the library from prying eyes. Believed to be related to [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Valentina\|Valentina]] and [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Iana\|Iana]], this has never been confirmed. His symbols are books and scrolls, fitting to the god of knowledge.
