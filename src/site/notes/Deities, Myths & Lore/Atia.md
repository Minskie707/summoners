The goddess of Souls and Life. Atia, much like Amros isnâ€™t one for confrontation. She believes that peace is most important to the world. Married to [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Calous\|Calous]], she was forced from her home in Cholk during an unpleasant riot. Forced to leave two of her children behind to find their own paths. No mortal has seen her since that day. She is the mother to [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Nutuna\|Nutuna]], [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Nythar\|Nythar]], [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Rytar\|Rytar]] and [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Aella\|Aella]]; having made them using her own blood and the power of the earth. Her symbols are newborn animals and saplings.
