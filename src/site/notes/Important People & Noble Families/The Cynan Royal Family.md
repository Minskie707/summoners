The Cynan royal family, a prestigious and strong house within [[World History/Palonia\|Palonia]]. The Cynan name has been known as the ruling name in [[World History/Palonia/Countries/Fostrela (Fahs-trel-uh)\|Fostrela (Fahs-trel-uh)]] since [[World History/The Night of Tau\|The Night of Tau]], having branched from the original royal name of Aurelian. The Cynan family is all about image, they are always shown in public as perfect, never a hair out of place. Vixgate is the capital of Fostrela, and subsequently the home to the Cynan royal family. Statistically having a human lineage, the current king is a human, however his queen is a high elf. Despite this change in lineage, the kingdom will fall to Balor’s only son and heir, Alden. The Cynan family has also recently joined the prestigious grouping of a Summoner household. Further solidifying their name into history. The families youngest, Ophelia is to be entering the Academy along side Kwyn at the start of the next term.

  

Members of the Cynan family are often known to flash their name as a “get out of jail free” card. The family holds their own blood higher than any deity, and history has shown that when things involve members of their family they don't abandon one another.

### Balor Cynan:

King Balor Mansfeild Cynan, the first of his name and the current king of Fostrela. King Balor was born to King Barnabus and Queen Nicolette Cynan, first of their names. Being the youngest of two, Balor was never supposed to inherent the throne. However after his older brother, Runark lost his life, Balor was set to inherent the throne. When King Barnabus died and Balor took the throne, the first thing he did was call a meeting with Caipra. No one knows what happened at that meeting, however the people believe this is where the marriage of their two children had been arranged, despite the fact neither child breathed air yet. Though that's all simply rumor and speculation. As the King hadn’t even wed yet. The King is, to put it simply, disliked by his people. He was known to have a hot temper before wedding Calla, simple things were known to set him off. Many were afraid of him going mad before he finally got married. The people had been suspicious when their King brought back a bride from the far islands of Estrye, however when they saw how calm their King had become in her presence they warmed up to her. Balor is a fairly serious man, who married Calla, a fairly unique woman.

### Calla Cynan:

Queen Calla Cynan, is inexperienced in nobility. She had been born to Minos and Leto Vasilius, merchants from Vilco. Named for her beauty, her full name is Callista. However she has always gone by Calla, even amongst the people of Fostrela she is known as Queen Calla. The Queen’s parents have never been seen and so no one knows who they are. Its said that the Queen has a strong distaste for the mention of her parents, or their company in Vilco ([[World History/Palonia/Countries/Estrye (Es-tray)\|Estrye (Es-tray)]]). Despite this, Calla fits into the title of queen quite well. She has the beauty and kindness of a true queen, and although she was never “trained” in the ways of nobility she holds herself high. The people of Vixgate have a strong fondness towards their Queen, much less so to their King.

### Alden Cynan:

Prince Alden Cynan, the oldest of the Cynan children and the heir to the throne of Fostrela. Currently, he is the same age as Dras Ilea, the two have been close since childhood. Alden is engaged to Kwyn Ilea, an arranged marriage. Although many were concerned with the age difference, as Alden is twenty one and Kwyn is sixteen. The marriage itself will have to wait until Kwyn completes her studies at the Academy. The Prince is a favorite among the people of Fostrela. Despite his cold demeanor he's known to be fairly kind and caring, though he holds a temper like his father’s. He currently works as a general in the City Watch.

### Arrabella Cynan:

Princess Arrabella Cynan, the middle child to the Cynan family. She has the beauty of her mother and the attitude of her father. Although the people speak of her beauty, the words of her kindness are scarce, given she has very little. In many ways Arrabella is similar to her father. The Princess has always had a strong personality, and a hot head. She's commonly known for her abuse towards her servants and sister, Ophelia. Rumors say she's blessed by [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Iana\|Iana]] herself, gifted with the beauty and jealousy. Currently Arrabella is eighteen, with a rather public fondness for Dras Ilea.

### Ophelia Cynan:

Princess Ophelia Cynan, the gifted youngest to the Cynan family. A frail girl, Ophelia’s entry to the Academy was a shock to the people. Especially given that she is only fourteen, it was unexpected to see her name on the acceptance listings. Its been centuries since someone younger than sixteen was accepted to the [[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]], and for it to be the first Cynan accepted as well. She certainly is making history with one simple letter. The name Ophelia has started to become very popular due to the Princess, the people see it as a lucky name. Ophelia, much like her sister and mother, is quite beautiful. With white hair like her mother, her flushed tone adds to her innocent look. Where Arrabella should be the highest on the bachelorette list, she would fall short in comparison to her sister Ophelia. That is of course once Ophelia turns of marriage age (sixteen) and completes her education at the academy.
