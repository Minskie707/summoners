The god of War. Rytar was enraged with the mortals after what had happened in Cholk, urging his parents to allow his revenge. However his mother forbade it, so he bit his tongue. The mortals who had started the riot knew better than to mess with his temper, however they believed his father, [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Calous\|Calous]], was not to be left alone. Rytar left with his parents as a protector of sorts, and also so that [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Atia\|Atia]] could keep an eye on him. Mortals have not seen or heard from him since that night in Cholk, however his mental connection to [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Nythar\|Nythar]] remains unbent. His symbols are blood and swords.
