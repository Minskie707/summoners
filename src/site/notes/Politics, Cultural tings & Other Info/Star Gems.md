# **Star Gems**

### **Origins of Starlit Stone**

Far rarer than their mundane crystal counterparts, **Star Gems** are a class of arcane gemstone discovered centuries ago in caverns scattered across multiple nations. Unlike the different [[Crystals & Magic/Crystal Types\|Crystal Types]], these stones were found embedded in otherwise ordinary rock, as if they had grown from the stone itself. Each gem emitted a soft, shimmering radiance—light that scholars compared to distant stars, giving rise to their name.

At first, Star Gems were treated as curiosities and fashioned into extravagant jewelry for nobles. Their beauty alone made them coveted. But as their presence among the elite grew, so too did the first accounts of unusual effects. Wearers of particular gems began reporting heightened senses, improved fortune, resilience, or subtle magical boons.

When the phenomenon was studied, arcanists uncovered a pattern:  
**those who received benefits from a given Star Gem type all shared the same birth month.**

Thus began the tradition of associating each Star Gem with a specific month and the magical resonance tied to those born under its sign.

The accordance of the months went as follows:

### **Mystic Resonance**

Star Gems possess a natural **attunement to the arcane essence of their corresponding birth month**, resonating most strongly with those born beneath that lunar cycle. When used as:

- **Spellcasting focus'**
    
- **Enchantment cores**
    
- **Inlays for weapons or armor**
    

they amplify innate magical ability, stabilize spellcasting, or enhance enchanted effects. A Star Gem properly attuned can transform a mundane item into a treasured heirloom.

Though spellcasters often seek them out, Star Gems are not limited to arcane use alone. Their energy can enhance physical prowess, sharpen instincts, or offer protective qualities even in the hands of non-spellcasters.

### **The Lost Artificer**

Much of the modern understanding of Star Gem application stems from the work of a prodigious young artificer whose innovations revolutionized their use. They devised methods to:

- Store spells safely within certain gem cuts
    
- Channel the gem’s resonance into mechanical constructs
    
- Stabilize volatile enchantments through gemstone arrays
    

However, before these techniques could be fully documented or distributed, the artificer mysteriously disappeared. Their incomplete research notes continue to circulate among scholars and treasure hunters, fueling rumors that the lost breakthroughs could unlock entirely new applications for Star Gems.

### **Rarity and Value**

Not all Star Gems are found in equal measure. Some birth-month varieties surface frequently in accessible caverns; others rest in depths too dangerous or remote for regular mining. This uneven distribution results in dramatic fluctuations in price and availability.

A Star Gem’s value is determined by:

- **Its rarity in natural deposits**
    
- **Its clarity and strength of starlight shimmer**
    
- **Its resonance intensity during attunement**
    

Even modest-sized specimens can fetch extraordinary sums in markets across the world.
