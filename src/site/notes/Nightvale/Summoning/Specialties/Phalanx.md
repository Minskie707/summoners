Phalanxes are defensive and relaxed. Known by other specialties as “lazy” due to their consistent use of their summons rather than their own abilities. Though Phalanxes seem the weakest of all summoners, their summons tend to be the strongest. People believe this to be due to their more fragile forms, most who choose the Phalanx specialty are known to break easily. Their summons also tend hold a unique ability to call themselves forward. Unlike other specialties, Phalanxes are known to have minimal bonds to their summons. Most only having the ability to magically translate their words.


The Phalanxes’ words are “My companion is my guardian”, their oath refers to their abilities. Phalanxes have a strong distaste for the talk from other specialties, their summons holding the same distaste.
