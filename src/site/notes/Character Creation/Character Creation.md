When creating a character for this campaign there are a few things to keep in mind outside of how you would ordinarily build a character. For starters I would recommend reading the following pages before creating a character as they pertain to the basis of the campaign's setting:

- [[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]]
- [[World History/Palonia\|Palonia]]
- [[World History/The Night of Tau\|The Night of Tau]]
- [[Deities, Myths & Lore/The Nightvale Curse\|The Nightvale Curse]]

While I would recommend reading most of what the [[Summoners Index\|Summoners Index]] has listed, I understand wanting to only read things pertaining to your character. Obviously with that being said, what's listed on this page is information every player character and NPC would have as common knowledge at the start of the campaign. When it comes to information your character might specifically know that much is up to you, any information posted to this site is posted with the knowledge that players might view it, so everything is available to be read if you wish to. (Anything that might pertain to lore you want that doesn't fit into anything listed can be discussed)

Players are expected to make a character of age **16**! This is a school setting, a school which holds *very* strict rules so no there are no *super seniors*. If you would like to make a character a few years *younger* than 16 we can discuss this, however 16 is the ***Oldest*** a character can be at the ***Start*** of the campaign. If you happen to be building a character to be a guest during the campaign we can discuss the age limits for you depending on the current positioning of the party and where they are in the story at the time you would be joining sessions.

For character species you are relatively free to pick what you would like however the following are **NOT** allowed for multiple reasons, some being redundant, others being something that would break the setting of the campaign behind the scenes, and some that I don't want to deal with honestly:

- any species which requires you to have died to achieve it, no being brought back from the dead
- constructs (unless you're a guest character not playing a summoner)
- Centaurs
- Kender
- Plasmoid
- Lineages (Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft)
- Kalashtar
- Creature types from the books, Valda's Spire of Secrets: Player Pack, Grim Hollow: Player Pack, Grim Hollow: Player's Guide, Obojima: Tales from the Tall Grass, The Crooked Moon Part One: Player Options & Campaign Setting, The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying (Except for Hobbits, they are allowed), and The Griffon's Saddlebag: Book Two.

For information that pertains specifically to building a playable character within the world of Palonia, listed below is the list of pages you should read to build a **functional** character utilizing the homebrew mechanics:

- [[Character Creation/Merits & Flaws\|Merits & Flaws]]
- [[Character Creation/Notoriety\|Notoriety]]
- [[Politics, Cultural tings & Other Info/Star Gems\|Star Gems]]
- [[Nightvale/Summoning/Summoning Specialties\|Summoning Specialties]]
