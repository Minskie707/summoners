This is the world history mortals are taught all over [[World History/Palonia\|Palonia]]. World history less known to the mortals of [[World History/Palonia\|Palonia]] is that of Keatara, a lush land with a perfectly balanced ecosystem. Keatara was known as the land of the gods well before [[World History/The Night of Tau\|The Night of Tau]]. Even in such a magically deprived world, the lands of Keatara seemed to have an almost magical glow to them. Unfortunately, on The Night of Tau, Keatara was one of the land masses to suffer the most damage from the meteor shower. The land was completely split in two. What was once Keatara is now known as the countries of [[World History/Palonia/Countries/Fostrela (Fahs-trel-uh)\|Fostrela (Fahs-trel-uh)]] and [[World History/Palonia/Countries/Abus (Ah-boos)\|Abus (Ah-boos)]]. The two countries have been at war with one another for as long as anyone or any book can account for, although more recently an unwilling truce has been formed between the two kingdoms.
