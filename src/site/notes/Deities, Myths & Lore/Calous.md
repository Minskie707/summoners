**Lore**  
Calous, God of Death, is the quiet guardian who stands at the threshold between worlds. Where his wife **[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Atia\|Atia]], Goddess of Souls and Life**, brings forth the breath of creation, Calous receives it when it fades. He is not a harbinger of fear or malice, but of inevitability—the stillness after the storm, the calm that follows pain, the truth that all things must one day rest.

In the earliest ages, mortals revered him as a necessary part of life’s balance. Yet, as generations passed, fear grew where reverence once dwelled. His temples darkened, his priests shunned, and his name became one spoken only in mourning. When a riot erupted in **Cholk**, the divine seat he shared with Atia, mortals rose against them in superstition and dread. It is said Calous did not resist—he simply rang his bell once, marking the death of his own temple. With Atia beside him, he turned away from the mortal world, leaving it to face the cycles they had forsaken.

Calous is father to **[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Rytar\|Rytar]], God of War**, the twins **[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Nythar\|Nythar]], God of Glory**, and **[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Nutuna\|Nutuna]], Goddess of Youth**, and their youngest daughter, **[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Aella\|Aella]], Goddess of the Moon**. He gave to each a fragment of mortality, ensuring that even divinity would know the limits of time and loss. Rytar inherited the weight of consequence, Nythar the pride of legacy, Nutuna the frailty of youth, and Aella the fleeting beauty of light.

He is believed to share ancient blood with **[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Kemara\|Kemara]], Goddess of Sleep**, and **[[Deities, Myths & Lore/Vearis\|Vearis]], God of the Skies**, though none have ever confirmed the truth. His essence is felt in their domains—stillness, silence, and the eternal expanse between moments.

Calous’s **symbols are the ouroboros and the belladonna**, each representing the endless cycle of death feeding life, and the beauty of what can end. His followers often wear rings or talismans shaped in his sigil, a reminder that the end of one thing sustains the beginning of another.

**Worship & Teachings**  
Calous’s faithful, called **The Order of the Final Bell**, serve as caretakers of the dead and keepers of sacred rest. They believe that death is not to be feared but respected, for it is the truest form of equality. To mourn without understanding is to reject his gift; to celebrate a life’s end is to honor his purpose.

His doctrine, whispered in funerary rites, teaches: _“All things return to stillness. All souls return to silence.”_ His priests conduct rites of passage for both mortals and spirits, ensuring no soul is lost to despair or bound to the living world.

Though no mortal has seen him since the fall of his temple in Cholk, the tolling of unseen bells often signals his presence. It is said that those who hear that soft sound in their dreams have been marked for death—but also for peace.

> “Death is not the end, only the closing of the eye before another dawn.”  
> —Scripture of the Final Bell
