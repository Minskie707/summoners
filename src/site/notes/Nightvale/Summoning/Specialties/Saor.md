Saors are elusive and one with nature. In the past few decades, they’ve shifted from the traditional rituals for their abilities, instead taking up dreams with the help of the specialties deity. Saors have interesting bonds with their summons, some believe their bonds are second in strength to Wargs. Saors are known to be the first to offer help to those in need, often choosing to sacrifice themselves rather than see another suffer. Something seen as drastically different from their need to be better than the other specialties.

  

The Saor’s words are “My companion is free”, their oath refers to their special bonds with their summons. Saors are strongest when they have their summons out, their abilities able to channel from the earth through their summons.
