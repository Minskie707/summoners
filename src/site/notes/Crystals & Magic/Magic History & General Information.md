## The Magic of Palonia

> _“The skies bled stars, and from their molten hearts came gods. From those gods came the first whispers of magic.”_  
> — Archmage Virell, _On the Night of Tau_

Long before the heavens cracked and the gods fell, [[World History/Palonia\|Palonia]] was a land of soil and stone, untouched by the arcane. Though life thrived in its forests and seas, there was no magic in its rivers, no power in its breath.

That changed on **[[World History/The Night of Tau\|The Night of Tau]]**, when meteors rained from the stars. Within those blazing stones were divine beings—the entities mortals would come to worship as the **Deities of Palonia**. In their wake, the world awoke to new forces. The gods, moved by curiosity or mercy, gifted mortals a fraction of their essence. Magic coursed through the land like veins of light, altering the fabric of life forever.

Today, the arcane flows freely through Palonia. Its mortals wield it through study, devotion, and instinct—each a reflection of the divine spark that first touched their world.

### The Eight Schools of Magic

Most mortals learn the structured paths of the **Eight Schools**:  
**Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy,** and **Transmutation.**  
These schools are the foundation of modern spellcraft and are taught in institutions such as **[[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]]**, where casters are trained to refine raw potential into disciplined artistry.

Yet not all magic is so easily classified. Some pursue the chaotic forces of **wild magic**, while others explore **forbidden or divine disciplines** whispered to be remnants of the gods’ original gift. (see [[Crystals & Magic/Magic Types\|Magic Types]])

### Spellcraft and Rituals

Though most spells can be cast through will and words, some demand intricate preparation. Advanced spellcasters often learn **ritualistic techniques**, calling upon runes, seals, and other symbolic tools to focus or amplify their magic. These practices trace back to the first mortal mages who sought to emulate divine creation.

## Magical Implements of Palonia

### Magic Seals & Circles

Two ancient practices remain central to structured spell work:

**Magic Seals** are compact arcane emblems inscribed upon parchment or metal. Pre-prepared and portable, they are activated by a drop of the user’s blood, channeling latent energy through runic script. A skilled artisan can embed a seal into an item for repeated use, though the process demands precise rune carving and exceptional focus.

**Magic Circles**, in contrast, are vast ritual constructs etched onto floors or terrain with **enchantment chalk**. Circles are precise instruments, drawn with glyphs or runes that channel tremendous magical energy when properly aligned. They are often used in summoning, warding, or large-scale spellcasting where precision outweighs convenience.

### Glyphs & Runes

Often collectively known as **sigils**, both glyphs and runes are ancient written forms of arcane language.

- **Glyphs** act as a magical alphabet, where each symbol represents a letter or sound. Complex spells are often formed from strings of glyphs, allowing casters to inscribe words, phrases, or even full incantations into a magical medium.
    
- **Runes** are more potent and far rarer. Each rune embodies a complete concept or word—_flame_, _bind_, _truth_, _death_. Mastery of runecraft requires deep understanding of both intent and balance, for a single misplaced line can warp the spell’s purpose entirely.

### Magic Charms

Known interchangeably as **talismans** or **charms**, these objects channel lingering enchantments or divine favor.

**Enchanted Charms** are common trinkets—useful, but modest in strength—often providing simple boons or one-use spell effects.

**Divine Charms**, however, are rare relics. Said to contain fragments of divine essence, they radiate power beyond mortal craftsmanship. Even to the untrained eye, their aura feels alive, pulsing with celestial resonance.

## Substances of Power

### Ether

A volatile essence born from corrupted divine energy, **Ether** is both a tool and a curse. When refined, it amplifies spells and enhances magical items. Yet in its raw state, Ether is deadly—its touch burns, its fumes poison, and its presence twists both body and mind.

Spells augmented by Ether are often stronger, but they take on darker manifestations—warped in color, tone, and sometimes intent. Many institutions, including Nightvale Academy, forbid its use beyond controlled environments.

---

### Liquid Starlight

If Ether is the shadow, **Liquid Starlight** is the light. This luminous substance flows like molten silver, glowing with a radiant, ethereal sheen. Far less volatile than Ether but infinitely rarer, it is said to condense only where starlight meets divine residue—most often near ancient celestial impact sites.

Spells cast using Liquid Starlight shine with radiant brilliance, embodying harmony rather than corruption. Few have ever seen it; fewer still have dared to use it.

### Star Gems

Believed to be crystallized fragments of divine essence, **Star Gems** shimmer with the same celestial glow as Liquid Starlight. Each gem corresponds to a month of birth, aligning with one’s fate and arcane resonance.

| Month     | Star Gem        | Description                                  |
| --------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Hammer    | Star Garnet     | Deep red with a shifting inner light.        |
| Alturiak  | Star Amethyst   | Violet crystal laced with starlike flecks.   |
| Ches      | Star Bloodstone | Dark green streaked with crimson shimmer.    |
| Tarsakh   | Star Diamond    | Clear as glass, radiant with prismatic fire. |
| Mirtul    | Star Emerald    | Verdant green, pulsing with gentle warmth.   |
| Kythorn   | Star Pearl      | Softly luminescent, pale as dawn.            |
| Flamerule | Star Ruby       | Brilliant crimson with a golden heart.       |
| Eleasis   | Star Sardonyx   | Layered amber and white with inner glow.     |
| Eleint    | Star Sapphire   | Deep blue, flecked with astral silver.       |
| Marpenoth | Star Opal       | Multicolored gleam, ever-shifting hues.      |
| Uktar     | Star Topaz      | Golden-orange, gleaming like sunset.         |
| Nightal   | Star Turquoise  | Azure green with radiant swirls of light.    |

Star Gems resonate most strongly with those born under their corresponding month. When used as a **spell focus** or **enchantment core**, they amplify the wielder’s innate magic. Advanced enchanters also use them to **store spells** or **infuse weapons and armor**, crafting heirlooms of rare power.

### The Balance of Magic

Palonia’s magic is both blessing and burden. Every light has its shadow; every divine echo bears a trace of corruption. Ether and Starlight, glyph and rune, divine and mortal—all are fragments of the same celestial event that forever changed the world.  
To wield magic in Palonia is to hold a piece of the gods—and to risk becoming what they once were.
