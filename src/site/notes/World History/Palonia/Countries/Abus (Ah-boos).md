**Abus — The Mountain Kingdom**

Across the rugged spine of [[World History/Palonia\|Palonia]] lies **Abus**, neighbor and counterpart to [[World History/Palonia/Countries/Fostrela (Fahs-trel-uh)\|Fostrela (Fahs-trel-uh)]]. Where Fostrela is clothed in forests and fertile woodlands, Abus rises in a jagged crown of stone. The mountains here are taller, denser, and far less forgiving, but beneath them lie veins of ore, rivers of crystal-clear water, and some of the richest natural resources in all the known world.

Yet, for all its wealth, Abus does not open its gates freely. Outsiders may pass through its borders, but only those with the coin or influence to afford entry are welcomed. Trade is tightly controlled, and [[Noble Families, Important People, & Guilds/The Silvestre Royal Family\|The Silvestre Royal Family]] ensures that the kingdom’s abundance remains firmly in their grasp. The Silvestres rule from the fog-shrouded capital of **Stextin**, their line long associated with strength, grandeur, and the divine blessing of frost.

### The Cities of Abus

**Stextin (Capital City)**

- _Climate:_ Mild, fog-laden.
    
- _Notable Features:_ Wide roads for goliaths and giants, grand colosseum, the Feast of the Moon.  
    The capital of Abus is a city of size and spectacle. Perpetual fog rolls through its streets, scattering lanternlight into a dreamlike glow. The city is famous for its **colosseum**, where the gods’ chosen clash in ritual combat, where summoners test their skill in [[Events & Festivals/The Summoners Gauntlet\|The Summoners Gauntlet]] & [[Events & Festivals/The Summoning Games\|The Summoning Games]] , and where champions face beasts from across the realms. Though Stextin is considered a city, its breadth and oversized structures give it the feel of a fortress built for titans. Every year, the Silvestres host the exclusive **[[Events & Festivals/Feast of the Moon Festival\|Feast of the Moon Festival]]**, an event whispered about throughout Palonia, attended only by those deemed worthy.

**Cholk**

- _Climate:_ Bitter cold, snowy.
    
- _Notable Features:_ Factories, wealthy estates, amphitheater.  
    Far to the north stands Cholk, Abus’ second-largest city. Its factories fuel the kingdom’s industry, their smoke rising against the snowy sky. Despite its industrial heart, Cholk is known for wealth and decadence, with its noble estates rivaling those of the capital. The most extravagant of these belongs to **Count [[Noble Families, Important People, & Guilds/Karken Spiros\|Karken Spiros]]**, whose sprawling vineyards, opulent mansion, and grand amphitheater dominate the outskirts. Here, the elite gather for his private performances and glittering feasts, where politics and theater intertwine.

**Noni**

- _Climate:_ Temperate, rainy.
    
- _Notable Features:_ Whaling community.  
    Along the southwestern coast lies Noni, a modest fishing town with a legacy tied to the sea. Sanctioned by the crown, its people hunt whales—not merely for survival, but as regulated sport. While humbler than the industrial Cholk, Noni is a proud town, where livelihoods are built on the waves. Its folk are pragmatic, hardworking, and skilled in their crafts, some branching into trades far from the ocean.

**Vrin**

- _Climate:_ Cool, cloudy.
    
- _Notable Features:_ Island artisans.  
    On a small island east of the mainland sits Vrin, a quiet settlement few outsiders ever visit. Though small in number, its people are remarkably skilled, each household seeming to master a particular craft or art. While the town itself appears unassuming, adventurers may find its population of specialists invaluable allies—or dangerous rivals.

**Panta**

- _Climate:_ Freezing, icy.
    
- _Notable Features:_ Dwarven stronghold, temple of Nutuna, subterranean city.  
    Panta is a dwarven stronghold carved into the mountains of Abus’s northeastern isles. Fiercely protective of their traditions, the dwarves here are known for hostility toward outsiders and exacting customs for those who dare to enter. On the surface, Panta appears to be a frozen settlement battered by wind and ice, but its heart lies **within the mountain itself**. Over centuries, the dwarves have tunneled into the stone, creating an underground city of ornate halls and carved homes. The sacred **Temple of [[Deities, Myths & Lore/Nutuna\|Nutuna]]** stands here as well, its deep sanctums hidden from all but the most devout.
