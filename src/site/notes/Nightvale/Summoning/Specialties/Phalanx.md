# **Phalanx Specialty**

_Summoning Discipline of [[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]]_

Phalanxes are pillars of quiet endurance. Stoic, deliberate, and unyieldingly calm, these summoners rely on the steadfast strength of their companions rather than their own physical prowess. While other disciplines rush forward or strategize with complexity, a Phalanx stands firm—letting their summons serve as shield, bulwark, and immovable wall.

---
## **Strength Through Stillness**

Students of the Phalanx specialty often appear relaxed, even indifferent, leading other summoners to wrongly label them as “lazy.” In truth, their discipline is one of trust: each Phalanx learns early that their bodies are more fragile than those of their peers, and their survival depends on the raw, overwhelming power of their summons.

Where others train their reflexes or magical prowess, Phalanxes instead refine their judgment—deciding when to call their guardians forth and when to hold the line. Their summons regularly outmatch those of other specialties in sheer durability and strength, a natural counterbalance to the summoner’s vulnerability.

---
## **Self-Summoning Guardians**

One of the most unique traits of this discipline is the phenomenon known as **Guardian Recall**—the innate ability of a Phalanx’s summons to project themselves forward without the summoner’s direct command. Whether sensing danger, responding to emotional fluctuation, or reacting to a threat unseen, these companions can take form independently, positioning themselves between their summoner and harm.

Academy scholars still debate whether this instinct arises from the Phalanx’s physical fragility or from the deep protective nature of the summons themselves.

---
## **Distant Bonds, Clear Voices**

Unlike the other [[Nightvale/Summoning/Summoning Specialties\|Summoning Specialties]], Phalanxes form minimal traditional bonds with their summons. Their connections lack the charged emotion or intricate tethering of other specialties. Instead, they rely on a subtle, almost spiritual resonance—one that allows them to understand their summons’ speech through magical translation that others cannot decipher.

This distant-yet-functional link is efficient, quiet, and perfectly suited to the Phalanx temperament.

---
## **Philosophy of the Oath**

Every Phalanx speaks the words that define their discipline:

### **“My companion is my guardian.”**

This oath embraces protection not as affection or possession, but as necessity. The summoner must endure, and the guardian must stand. Their relationship is not intimate or emotional—it is resolute.

---
## **Public Perception**

To other specialties, Phalanxes appear apathetic or weak-willed, hiding behind the power of their companions. Such judgments are met with cool disinterest. Phalanxes rarely waste time defending their reputation; their summons often do so for them, bristling at insults or dismissive remarks with a quiet but unmistakable threat.

In truth, their silence masks a profound confidence—an understanding that strength need not shout.
