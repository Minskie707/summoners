# **Nightvale Academy: Challenge Protocols**

### **The Vega-Level Trials**

Upon reaching the **Vega Level**, every summoning student of [[Nightvale/Nightvale Academy\|Nightvale Academy]] is formally initiated into the Academy’s system of **Challenges**—structured combat trials designed to test discipline, technique, and the crucial bond between summoner and summon. Vega-level challenges are intentionally grueling, pushing students to their physical, mental, and arcane limits.

Students may earn **Challenge Tickets**, a coveted reward that allows the bearer to **choose their opponent** rather than face the foe assigned by [[Nightvale/The Nightvale Council\|The Nightvale Council]]. Chosen or assigned, opponents may include:

- Dangerous creatures and summoned beasts
    
- Fellow Nightvale students
    
- Specially designated hazards or environments
    
- Unique “scenario trials” where the surroundings pose the true threat

### **Mats, Pits, and Protocol**

Nightvale Academy maintains two primary combat zones:

#### **The Training Mats**

- Located in the gymnasium.
    
- Used exclusively for sparring, form practice, and tactical drills.
    
- **Non-lethal only.**
    
- Lethal intent on the mats is grounds for immediate disciplinary action.

#### **The Pits**

- A vast, arena-like chamber carved through the academy’s first level.
    
- Features **multiple circular fighting pits** of varying sizes.
    
- Subterranean tunnels connect the pits to:
    
    - A gated entrance for combatants
        
    - A small but efficient infirmary for emergency care
        

Spectators view from the upper level, protected by reinforced railings. Benches line the walls, though few choose to sit during high-intensity bouts.

**All official Challenges—individual or group—must be fought in the pits or within the sanctioned region.**  
Once a challenge begins, **no one may interfere** until a combatant formally taps out. In many trials, the difference between tapping out and falling unconscious is a matter of survival. Students are warned:  
**“Do not die for your pride.”**

### **Structure of Challenges**

Challenges are announced in advance, though the details of opponents or conditions may remain secret until the moment combatants enter the pits.

Prizes are occasionally awarded—treasures, permissions, or rare academy boons—though they are always considered worth “the pain required to earn them.”

---

#### **Individual Challenges**

These form the majority of Vega-level trials. Each student fights alone to demonstrate skill, adaptability, and mastery over their summons.

---

#### **Group Challenges**

On rare occasions, the Nightvale Council calls for **party-wide challenges**, in which an entire adventuring group must face the trial together. These events draw enormous crowds and serve as both entertainment and advanced tactical study.

- Younger students witness the ferocity awaiting them in future years.
    
- Upper classmen observe, critique, and sometimes mock the lower years—often finding grim amusement in their terror.

### **Lethality Rules**

- **Allowed** in sanctioned pit challenges.
    
- **Forbidden** on training mats or during sparring exercises.
    
- Intent to kill outside approved conditions is met with swift punishment.
    

Nightvale Academy holds that violence, when wielded with purpose, is a tool. Violence without constraint is a danger—one the Academy refuses to tolerate.
